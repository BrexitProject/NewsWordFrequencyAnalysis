David Cameron pleads with voters to choose Remain so UK can reshape EU2016-6-20DAVID Cameron today calls on wavering voters to give him a powerful mandate to reshape the EU for the better by voting to stay in it on Thursday.A referendum victory would put Britain in a “very enhanced position” to “drive forward changes”, the PM insisted.And top of his list will be a tougher clamp down on freedom of movement, Mr Cameron said, declaring: “We want as much as we can achieve with that.”The PM issued the pledge during an interview with The Sun yesterday - one of his last before the landmark poll in just 48 hours time.Quizzed on whether he agreed with Theresa May’s call for “further reform” to tighten immigration rules, he vowed to use the UK’s rotating six-month presidency of the EU next year to push through his agenda. Mr Cameron said: “If we stay in, that is not the end of reform.“Britain will be in a very enhanced position.“There is no doubt that a British Prime Minister with a mandate from the election, a re-negotiation, and a referendum would have the ability in Europe to drive forward changes that are needed.”DAVID Cameron has lashed out at Michael Gove’s attack on experts to accuse him of “Donald Trump-style” politics.Ramping his assault on Leave campaign bosses, the PM also accused them of “selling a fantasy” to voters and vowed to “call that out”.The PM’s broadside is his most stinging yet on his fellow senior Tories and will only deepen the party’s bitter civil war.Pro-Brexit Justice Secretary Mr Gove last month dismissed warnings from “establishment” economists such as the Bank of England against leaving the EU by saying:“People in this country have had enough of experts”.Hitting back in his interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said: “The idea we should not listen to experts I think is very worrying for our future politics.“If we are going into a ‘let’s not listen to anyone who knows what they are talking about’, it is just sort of Donald Trump-style, it is all going to be great.“I worry.”The PM also insisted it would be a “tragedy” for Britain to walk away from Brussels because “people have been told things which are simply not true”.He highlighted what he dubbed “three untruths” on most of Vote leave’s leaflets – narrowly stopping short of accusing Mr Gove and Boris Johnson of telling outright lies.And he accused the Leave campaign of having “morphed into the UKIP campaign”.Mr Cameron said: “All they are talking about is unless you leave, Turkey is going to join. Not true.“They are being told unless you leave £350m a week is going to go to Brussels. Not true.“They are being told we are going to be part of a European army. Not true.“And they are endlessly talking about migration, often in a way that is designed to frighten, scare and divide people. And that is all that they are left with.”On immigration, modest victories in Brussels to keep out criminals, sham marriage holders and benefits scroungers is far from  the end of his ambitions, Mr Cameron insisted, but part of “an on-going process”.He added: “We have got to deliver all the things that we said, plus I hope more.“We are re-opening the free movement directive. We want as much as we can achieve with that - the more you can do the better.“We have got the UK presidency coming up, we should be leading this organisation not leaving it.”But he warned: “All of these things are on the agenda if we stay, and they are all gone forever if we leave.”The fresh reform pledges are the first insight the Premier has offered into his post-referendum victory plan to pacify millions of Brits who will vote for Brexit.A THIRD of all Brits are still not totally convinced how to vote in the knife-edge EU referendum with just 48 hours to go, a massive survey has found.The online voter advice test by tech firm Crowdpac has also revealed the race is still almost tied, with 50% currently backing Leave and 49% for Remain.A huge total of 567,998 people underwent the sophisticated test, devised by former No10 strategy chief Steve Hilton.Once their responses were weighted for national balance, a total of 68% were found to have a firm view on how to vote.But even at this late stage, 31% said they found arguments on both sides persuasive – meaning there could still be all to play for.The huge number of respondents also allowed Crowdpac to produce detailed regional breakdowns of voting intentions on Thursday.Scotland and London are the country’s two areas that will overwhelmingly vote to stay in, and the North, the East and the Midlands will definitely vote to get out.But the South East, the South West and Wales are split almost down the middle.In a boost to the Leave campaign, the Crowdpac survey also found Brexit has a slight lead overall on the economic arguments – which Remain bosses consider their strongest point.Instead, the In campaign has a lead on questions of society and identity.Crowdpac CEO Steve Hilton said: “This is the biggest ever survey of British voters and it shows it’s all to play for as the referendum campaigns move into the crucial final phase.“The Crowdpac survey is not like normal polls — the result comes after voters have completed a questionnaire with all the main arguments presented objectively.”He also highlighted fighting terrorism, slashing red tape and signing more trade deals with the rest of the world as his other EU reform priorities.The fresh wave of reforms come on top of a series of successes in recent years with the EU that have got “almost no attention”, the PM insisted.They include re-writing EU law to enforce the removal of 6,000 EU citizens from the UK for free movement abuses, such sleeping rough and not working.But the promise of more reform also risks backfiring.Leave campaigners leapt on the PM’s vow last night to insist  it highlights his failure to win meaningful concessions to curtail free movement in his renegotiation for a new deal just four months ago.Vote Leave  Chief Executive Matthew Elliott branded the PM’s promisies “an admission of failure”, adding: “He tried to get reform but failed spectacularly.“No one will believe his claim now that an IN vote would somehow unlock more reforms later down the track.If we vote to stay in the EU politicians will laugh in our face if we ask for more.”Mr Cameron will spend the final 48 hours of the referendum fight ramping up the risks of leaving the EU in a bid to sway up to five million still undecided voters away from backing Brexit.Speaking on a train to a campaign visit in Birmingham yesterday, he also tried to highlight the security risks of Brexit.Leaving the EU would “divide the West and divide democracies” against threats such as ISIS or Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Mr Cameron claimed.BREXIT could slap an extra £200 a year on drivers’ fuel pump bills, David Cameron last night claimed.The PM told The Sun that leaving the EU will spark a sharp drop in the value of the Pound by as much as 20 per cent.That will ramp the cost to garage owners of importing petrol and diesel, which they will pass on to consumers, and Sun readers will suffer the most.Mr Cameron claimed: “It could put £200 on a typical fuel bill for the year for someone driving a Ford Focus.“If the pound goes down, the cost of petrol goes up.”In a bid to flag up the risks of Brexit to ordinary people’s pockets, the PM added: “My worry is that the people who will be hit the hardest by leaving the EU are hardworking Sun readers, who want to support their families.“That is just one aspect of where people who not necessarily on high wages are the most at risk of an exit where we see the economy shrink, opportunities go down and we lose jobs.”Last month, Leave campaign boss Boris Johnson insisted Brexit would have the opposite effect on fuel prices by liberating.Breaking free from Brussels would the end EU’s “stranglehold” on our pumps by letting the British government slash VAT on fuel below the current 15 per cent floor set by Brussels.But the PM hit back at the ex-Tory London Mayor’s promise to brand it “fantasy” economics”.And he named ex-MI6 chief Sir John Sawyers and former MI5 boss Lord Evans as “the two people who have influenced me on this more than anybody else”, adding: “They are in no doubt that the cooperation we have, the work we do together is incredibly important”.Despite the bitter Tory civil war that he and George Osborne have ignited with “Project Fear” scare claims, the PM insisted he regrets nothing about his explosive campaign.Instead, he vowed to press on with his dire warnings right up until Thursday.Mr Cameron said: “I have said the things that I want to say, about the strength of our economy, the strength of our country, the safety that we get in numbers at a time of difficulty.“And I am just going to go on saying them, and that is that.”Challenged on why he had failed to reassure voters so far on the tinderbox issue of immigration, Mr Cameron admitted it was “a very difficult challenge in a modern economy and in a globalised world”.There were no simple solutions to halt the massive influx of new arrivals that has reduced his target to tatters, the PM also claimed, saying that “simple can sometimes be simplistic”.The PM’s plea to voters came as one of the EU’s two chiefs yesterday admitted the UK’s referendum was “a warning signal” and Europe must now change.DAVID Cameron knew his target to cut immigration to “tens of thousands” was impossible for four years but continued to make the pledge, one of his closest former aides claimed last night.Steve Hilton – who attended top-level meetings with the Prime Minister – said civil servants directly warned the PM he was on mission impossible because EU rules insist on the free movement of people.But despite being told in 2012 it was a no-go, he said Mr Cameron repeated the promise – even including it in his general election manifesto last year.In an interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Hilton said: “We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it.”Just weeks ago the PM insisted he stuck by his “ambition” of bringing net migration into the UK – which last month hit 333,000.Mr Hilton added: “You don’t need to sit in a ‘stock take’ meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we’re in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it.“In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable.“When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave.“For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what (Michael) Gove and (Boris) Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics.”EU Council President Donald Tusk said: “Whatever the UK vote is, we must take long hard look on the future of the Union.“It would be foolish to ignore such a warning signal.“There are more signals of dissatisfaction with the Union from all over Europe, not just the UK.”Issuing his own plea to British voters, former Polish PM Mr Tusk added: “I appeal to the British citizens: stay with us, we need you.“Together we will cope with future challenges, apart it will be more difficult.”Mr Tusk also said his feelings are shared by “almost all Europeans and European Leaders”.Backing him up, EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker added his own plea for a Remain vote, saying the union would have “a missing element” without Britain’s pragmatism and no-nonsense approach.Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Claims Brexit would spell economic doom dismissed as a ‘very British apocalypse’ after pound rallied2016-6-23FEARS of economic doom as share values dramatically tumbled have been dismissed as a "very British Apocalypse" after the pound rallied in a spectacular Brexit bounce back.Doom-mongers were stunned as the index of Britain’s biggest blue-chip companies ended up worth more last night than at the start of the week.It's after a major American bank denied speculation it was planning to move 2,000 jobs abroad following the shock referendum result.Suzanne Evans, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner and Ukip spokesperson, said: "If this was the predicted apocalypse, well, it was a very British one."It was all over by teatime. Not a bad first day of freedom."The pound plunged to a 31-year low in a matter of moments after Britain voted to leave the European Union.But it wasn't long before the stock market fought back more than half its losses before closing down 3.2 per cent or 199.41 points at 6138.69.One astonished investment analyst said after the City had one of its biggest roller-coasters ever: “It’s been a remarkable day,”Across the rest of Europe, traders were gripped by panic at the vote to quit the EU. It sent foreign stock markets into free-fall.On the other side of the Channel in FRANCE, the Cac 40 plummeted by 6.8 per cent. In GERMANY the Dax closed 5.82 per cent down.Spain saw its Ibex index hit by a 12.35 per cent slide, the biggest loss in its 24-year history.In Italy the reaction was even worse as its FTSE MIB collapsed by a whopping 12.48 per cent.Even the Nikkei in Japan was not immune from the shock waves of the result. It closed 7.92 per cent down.Back in the UK, those predicting a meltdown in the City were at first left rubbing their hands in glee as the FTSE 100 opened.It crashed by seven per cent — wiping a colossal £100billion off its value. At one stage early on it sank to just over 5,800 points.Tony Cross, of investment supermarket Trustnet Direct, said it was the “biggest one-day loss in point terms” since its launch in 1984.Fellow market analyst Chris Beauchamp, of online trader IG, described it as “an opening of cataclysmic proportions”.But then came a fightback which saw a quarter of the Footsie’s stocks actually make gains.By close of trading it was back up to 6,138.69, meaning it was just 199.41 down, or 3.15 per cent.That was higher than it had been on Monday and was the first weekly gain in a month. Analyst Mr Beauchamp said: “In purely market terms, the FTSE 100 has staged a remarkable recovery.“Markets are discovering how to live in a post-Brexit world, a state of affairs that seemed impossible just 24 hours ago.”He said of the losses elsewhere: “The ripples of the UK’s decision today will be felt across the globe, and for a long time to come.”The Footsie’s big gainers included Guinness maker Diageo, which was up 2.45 per cent.Another was drugs firm Glaxo-SmithKline which saw its shares rise 3.71 per cent.Tobacco giant Imperial Brands was up 0.42 per cent.Our City Editor Rhodri Phillips explains the ups and downs on the markets after the vote for Brexit:The stock markets hate uncertainty – but after an early wobble the FTSE 100, like the rest of us, appears to be coming to terms with Brexit.Britain’s blue chip companies are now worth more than on Monday morning – and significantly more than on February 20, when the EU poll was called.Some stocks, such as Guinness-maker Diageo, drugs firm GlaxoSmithKline and tobacco seller Imperial Brands are even up for the day.London’s index of top firms is outperforming the markets in Germany, France and Japan – and is likely to do so in the coming weeks.This is because a weakened pound will be a boon for exporters, like engine maker Rolls-Royce.Look at a graph of the FTSE 100 since the start of the month and it traces the ups and downs of a crazy rollercoaster ride.It tumbled for a week from June 8, as opinion polls showed the chances of a Brexit were growing.Then it picked up on Thursday last week in the wake of England’s Euro 2016 victory over Wales – and rose steadily in recent days as polls veered more towards a Bremain.Today’s crash was inevitable, but brief, and despite panic in the City, the FTSE 100 is now on the way back.We are likely to see some more lurches and drops in the coming weeks and months.But this isn’t a return to the crazy volatility of the credit crunch.Among significant fallers were banks and housebuilders.Barclays was down 17.67 per cent, Lloyds fell 21 per cent, and RBS dropped 18.04 per cent.Taylor Wimpey ended the day down 29.26 per cent and Persimmon fell 27.55 per cent.The initial reaction to yesterday’s Brexit vote had also looked grim for the Pound.It fell ten per cent against the dollar and at one point was worth just $1.31, a 30-year low.But by the evening it had settled around $1.36, meaning $1 was worth around 73p.Economist John Hearn, of the London Institute of Banking and Finance, described it as a “win, win, win for the UK economy” after the Pound almost hit £1.50 days ago — when a Remain vote had looked a virtual certainty.He said: “The fall in the exchange rate benefits UK exporters by lowering prices.“It helps the domestic producer by making their products more price competitive and does not affect the rate of inflation.”He said of the UK shedding its EU shackles: “We can look forward to faster rates of economic growth as we embrace the world economy.”His views were echoed by buoyant JCB king Lord Bamford. He declared: “We should look ahead to opportunities to trade more freely with the rest of the world.The Brexit vote was good news for the gold market as those with the jitters rushed to invest. Prices rose 22 per cent.Across the Atlantic, the US Federal Reserve said it was “closely monitoring” the reaction of markets after the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 2.8 per cent lower.Last night experts predicted any big Brexit impact on the UK economy would see Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cut its interest rate to zero.David Tinsley, economist at bank UBS, said the cut could happen before next February.The prediction came as forecasts for growth were downgraded.THE Bank of England has £250billion at hand to keep the markets stable, Governor Mark Carney said yesterday.He warned that “some market and economic volatility can be expected” after the Brexit vote.But he said the Bank “is monitoring developments closely and has undertaken extensive contingency planning”.He added that besides being ready to provide more than £250billion “the Bank won’t hesitate to take additional measures as required as markets adjust and the UK economy moves forward”.Mr Carney, right, said there will be “no initial change in the way our people can travel, our goods can move or our services can be sold”.He added: “It’ll take time for the UK to establish new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world.”The Bank vowed to “take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability”.Capital Economics estimated it will be 1.5 per cent this year, down from its pre-Brexit forecast of just over 2 per cent.Britain also faces losing its coveted AAA credit rating.Moritz Kraemer, chief ratings officer at Standard and Poor’s, described it as “untenable under the circumstances”.Rival ratings agency Moody’s said the Leave vote will “weigh on the UK’s economic and financial performance”.But it added: “We expect that, over time, the UK and the EU would come to an arrangement to preserve most — but probably not all — of the current trading relationships.”BRITAIN’S credit rating was last night lowered from stable to negative.Agency Moody’s expects growth to slow and public finances to weaken, making it harder to cut national debt.It also warned  economic policymaking could suffer as Britain struggles through the break-up.The overall rating was kept at AA+, the second highest. It is three years since Moody’s cut it from AAA.We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team? Email us at tips@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4368 

Brussels bigwig Jean-Claude warns Britain there’s ‘no second chance’ if UK turns backs Brexit2016-6-22EUROPEAN Union boss Jean-Claude Juncker risked infuriating British voters by threatening to isolate us if we vote to leave the EU.The European Commission president was joined by other ­leaders to insist that there would be no second deal on offer to the UK if it chooses Brexit.Every time a member country has voted down a new EU treaty or plan in the past, it has always been offered better terms.But the UK would not be, Mr Juncker declared, saying instead: “Out is out.”In another explosive outburst, the federalist chief Eurocrat also questioned whether it was right to hold referendums at all.Senior Tories slammed the explosive statement on the eve of the poll as “unbelievable conceit”.But Mr Juncker also appeared to close the door on any further reforms to the EU’s free movement rules — pledged by the PM to Sun readers on Tuesday — even if the UK votes to remain In.The commission boss said David Cameron had already “got the maximum” with his renegotiation in February, panned by Conservative MPs as “thin gruel”.Former Luxembourg PM Mr Juncker insisted: “British voters have to know that there will not be any kind of renegotiation.“We have concluded a deal with the Prime Minister, he got the ­maximum he could receive, we gave the maximum we could give.”Continuing his Brussels rant, arrogant Mr Juncker also slammed the mere idea of giving people a say.Admitting he is “basically not a big fan of referendums”, Mr Juncker added: “Voters can be easily misled by sideshows.“You always get the sweats when someone dares to ask the people for its opinion.”He also admitted Brexit would “damage” the EU project, adding: “The British need the EU and the EU needs British pragmatism.”France’s President Hollande backed up the rant yesterday by also insisting there would be no second deal if voters back Brexit.He claimed “the future of the European Union is at stake”.The Socialist leader dubbed today’s landmark referendum “irreversible”, parroting Mr Cameron’s campaign mantra.Issuing a new veiled threat, Mr Hollande also said Brexit would put Britain at “very serious risk” of losing access to the European Union bloc’s single market.While reinforcing Mr Cameron’s message, the stern last-minute warnings could also backfire on the Remain campaign if they encourage voters across the country to rebel against the EU’s elite.Leave campaigners seized on the threats to insist the Prime Minister was wrong to offer British voters false hope of more EU reform.Brexit campaign boss and Justice Secretary Michael Gove said: “If you vote to stay, there is no prospect of getting any reform from the EU ever again.“The Prime Minister tried to get reforms earlier this year but the EU did not listen.”Mr Gove added: “The EU cannot and will not give the British people the change that they want.”Furious Boris Johnson weighed in, saying: “The president of the European Commission has basically just told David Cameron to bog off.“We’ve already been given the maximum we’re going to get? This is unbelievable, the conceit of these people, what gives him the right?“This isn’t a head of state, this isn’t the head of an elected government.”The former London Mayor added: “Who in the holy **** elected Jean Claude Juncker to anything?“He used to run Luxembourg, it’s a lovely place but about the same size as Wolverhampton.”German leader Angela Merkel held back from an eleventh hour threat after a plea from Downing Street to stay out of the fight four weeks ago.Instead Mrs Merkel issued a plea to voters to back Remain, saying: “Of course I want Britain to stay in the EU but the decision is with British citizens.”On Tuesday, Mr Cameron urged Sun readers to back Britain staying in the EU so he could reform it from within.The Prime Minister claimed: “If we stay in, that is not the end of reform.“Britain will be in a very enhanced position.”

Turkey accuses EU of being against the ‘Muslim-majority country’ as membership talks are delayed2016-6-24TURKEY’S hardline president stepped up his blackmailing of Europe yesterday as he slammed the EU for stalling over talks to let the country join the bloc.President Erdogan accused the EU of being against the “Muslim-majority country” and threatened to hold a British-style referendum to see whether Turks want to continue trying to join the EU or give up altogether.The threat comes with the EU desperate to keep Turkey on side to solve the migrant crisis.Lashing out at Brussels in a ranty speech, President Erdogan said: “We can stand up and ask the people just like the British are doing.“We would ask ‘Should we continue the negotiations with the European Union or should we end them? If the people say ‘continue’ then we would carry on.”Ankara and Brussels first signed an agreement stating Turkey would become a member back in 1963.Turkey officially applied in 1987 and accession talks began in 2005 but its bid has been held up by an array of problems including major concerns about its human rights record.Brussels agreed to speed up membership talks as part of a deal to tackle the migrant crisis and a new chapter will be opened next week.That sparked accusations from Brexit campaigners that David Cameron had “lied to the British people” after the PM insisted Turkey was not on course to join – in a bid to defuse worries its 75 million population will pile new immigration pressure on Britain.President Erdogan used his speech to accuse Europe of wanting to oust him, and said the EU was welching on a deal for visa-free travel in exchange for help stopping the flow of migrants.He said: “You are not keeping your promise. This is your ugly face. When Erdogan exposes your ugly face you go crazy,” he said.“And that is why you are making efforts on ‘how do we get rid of Erdogan’.”Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted the referendum comments were “not a blackmail or a threat”.He said: “We are also under great pressure from our people who ask us what we are doing in a place where there is so much anti-Turkish sentiment.”

Emotional scenes as Samantha Cameron watches her husband resign as Prime Minister2016-6-24DAVID Cameron's doting wife looked devastated as she watched her defeated husband resign as Prime Minister after losing his fight to stay in the European Union.Sobbing Samantha stood at the sidelines as a rock of support for the PM who admitted "this ship needs a new captain" following a vote for Brexit by millions of people across the UK.Cameron grabbed his wife's hand after an emotional three-minute speech outside Downing Street before disappearing through No 10 without answering any questions from the press."The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected," Cameron said."The country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction."He added: "I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination."This is not a decision I've taken lightly but I do believe it's in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required."Although there was sorrow for the Camerons, a joyful Boris Johnson said the Brexit vote is a“glorious opportunity” to regain power over our borders and laws hours.The former London Mayor praised his fellow Tory and old friend as “one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age” in a press conference for the victorious Vote Leave campaign just hours after his resignation.Gove applauded the PM for leading the UK with "courage, dignity and grace"."He deserves to be remembered as a great Prime Minister," he added.Johnson said: "I believe we now have a glorious opportunity - we can pass our laws and set our taxes entirely to the needs of the UK economy"We can control our borders in a way that is not discriminatory, but fair and balanced and take the wind out of the sails of the extremists and those who would play politics with immigration."Above all, we can find our voice in the world again... powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary force for good in the world."As a three-month contest begins for Conservative leadership, Labour was also plunged deeper into a crisis as MPs call for Jeremy Corbyn to resign as leader.Some said he should be forced to quit after his "seemingly half-hearted" support for the UK to remain in the European Union.One senior MP said: “He is toast."If we go into a general election with him as leader, we will be wiped out. The shadow cabinet has got to tell him to go.”Another added: “Jeremy’s campaign and its focus on freedom of movement showed he clearly does not understand the mood of the country."Labour should be looking for a new leader.”Members of the Labour Party have this afternoon submitted a no-confidence motion in leader Jeremy Corbyn.Senior Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge filed a motion which was seconded by Ann Coffey - but Corbyn has refused to stand down.It's right that David Cameron has gone. Not a bad man just on the wrong side of the argument.Jubilant Nigel Farage has been celebrating Britain's Independence Day as he plots to make June 23 a Bank Holiday.The Ukip leader delivered his post EU referendum result speech in London this morning.He said: "The EU is failing, the EU is dying and I hope we've knocked the first brick out of the wall."I hope this is the first step towards a Europe of sovereign nation states; trading together, neighbours together, friends together - but without flags, anthems or useless old unelected presidents."We pay for your stories!

A vote to leave will give power back to the British people, who will once again be able to hold their government to account2016-6-23IT is finally here, the day Britain has been waiting for, the day this great country can take back its destiny.If we vote to leave the European Union, we will wake up tomorrow in a Britain where a new door has opened to a stunning future for our children and grandchildren.It will be up to us to build that future because we will have our democracy back.No more pointless shaking our fists at those people in Brussels who we never voted for and who won’t let us do the things we know Britain needs.I will never forget the excitement of being at Wembley Arena on Tuesday night, the electricity in the crowd when Boris Johnson told them today could be our Independence Day.Our campaign has given a vision for Britain as a nation again free to make its own laws and decisions.People everywhere have told me how they want to get back the power to shape their country.That means things like controlling our borders. My Labour colleague Gisela Stuart is an immigrant, I am the daughter of immigrants.Britain can only succeed by being the open-minded, welcoming place we know it is.That is why it is important we have immigration the British people are happy with and the security we need.By voting Leave, we will get back control of the billions of pounds we send to the EU every year.That will mean we can make laws and trade agreements that our businesses need to power ahead and create jobs and prosperity.They will not be held back by the never-ending Brussels bureaucracy.We will have a healthy relationship with our European neighbours.The head of the biggest organisation representing German businesses said yesterday it is essential free trade continues if we leave.The Remainers have so little faith in Britain and the abilities of its people.They have shown a shocking lack of confidence in Britain’s strength.But Sun readers know how great this country is, and I know you believe in it passionately.A vote to leave will give power back to the British people, who will once again be able to hold their government to account.It is the optimistic, patriotic choice. It is the gift we can pass on to the next generation.Let’s go vote Leave today. Let’s take back our independence.

Gran told she couldn’t vote because she was ‘inappropriately dressed’ in Union Jack garb2016-6-24A GRANDMOTHER claims she was told to leave a polling station yesterday after turning up wearing a Union Jack dress and draped in a St George's Cross flag.Passionate Brexit supporter Teresa Hicks, 68, says polling staff told her she was inappropriately dressed and so wasn't allowed to cast her ballot.She was also wearing Union Jack glasses and flags attached to a headband and claims she was told the police would be told unless she left immediately.Teresa said: "I was just in the queue and this man came up to me and said 'you are inappropriately dressed' so I asked if they'd send somebody away with a burka on?"I even offered to put a coat around the poster which I had around my waist but they just said 'no'."I went outside but the same man told me if I didn't leave leave the premises he was going to call the police."I did leave but it wasn't right."I think it's disgusting."Say I was Indian and I was in a Sari would they turn me away?"If someone was in a Burka would they sent them away?"I think it was discrimination."Grandmother-of-two Teresa, of Stevenage, Herts, was also carrying a homemade Brexit banner, which read: "Vote to leave the EU."Make 23 June Independence Day".She later went back to the same polling station in Mobbsbury Way, Stevenage, Herts, to cast her vote with her daughter Donna Hicks, 40,But as she walked through the door she saw two police officers and feared she'd be prevented from voting again.She said: "I went back a short time later."I took the banners off but kept everything else on."There were a few people in the queue this time and the same man came over to me.He said 'I told you this morning you can't come in like that'."He went over and talked to some other staff but they let me vote."I can't believe I had to go through all this just to vote."It's my right."This referendum is not like voting in the local elections - this vote on the EU is so important."Suffragettes died for women to have the vote and I feel very angry at being turned away from trying to exercise my democratic right."I'm very angry - in fact you could call me Mrs Angry."Teresa, a retired civil servant, is a passionate Eurosceptic who believes the UK should leave.She added: "I am passionate about leaving."It is not just about immigration, I have got family that are not English and who have come here."I'm not against it and I have got friends who are foreign."It is just that we can't take any more people."What gets me is the people setting the rules for us we don't even vote for."We need to come out."Scott Crudgington, Returning Officer for Stevenage, Herts., said: "I understand a resident was asked to leave one of our polling stations in Stevenage today because she was carrying a 'vote leave' placard."I am sorry if this caused her any distress but it is important that polling stations are kept neutral and free from any campaign material that could influence other voters."I believe that the resident returned without the placard and was able to cast her vote."

Boris Johnson urges Sun readers ‘with history in their hands’ to back Brexit2016-6-22BORIS JOHNSON urged millons of Sun readers "holding history in their hands" to back a Brexit — and “let the Lion roar again”.Speaking on the eve of the biggest vote for two generations the Tory heavyweight said the Leave campaign was “on the verge of history”.And he told wavering voters it was time to “cry freedom” by BeLeaving in Britannia — and throwing off the shackles of the European Union.He was speaking to the Sun during a whistlestop 500 mile tour of Britain where he was asked to kiss a fish in London, flew by helicopter to a former WWII airfield and ended the day pulling pints in the north-east.He was met by hordes of Out voters everywhere he went, stopping for selfies every 10 metres before joking: “Where are these Remain supporters the polls keep telling us about?”But with experts claiming today’s Referendum is still too close to call, the Brexit standard bearer implored Sun readers to make the crucial difference and make June 23 ‘Independence Day’.In a passionate Churchillian-style plea, he branded the Referendum a “Battle for British democracy”.And he said: “Sun readers have the future of our country in their hands.“They represent the best of Britain, the best of British instinct, and I know they believe in our great country and I hope very much they want to take our country forward tommorow on a path toward greater democracy, greater openness to trade with the rest of the world and a more dynamic future for Britain.“They know the brave cross they put on the ballot paper can make the difference between restoring democracy in Europe or remaining shackled to Europe.“It will be a historic moment.”And he stormed: “It’s time to take the chains off the giant, unshackled Britannia and let the Lion roar again!”As BoJo flew the flag, fellow Brexit backing Tory Michael Gove hit the south coast with Armed Forces Minister Penny Mordaunt.Speaking on the campaign trail in Bournemouth, Mr Gove warned a vote for Remain today would mean it was “game over” for Great Britain as Brussels would never change their ways.He said the Eurocrats running the EU would “never reform”.Separately, Out campaiging Jobs Minister Priti Patel delivered a rousing battle cry to vote leave — urging votes to “take back our destiny”.She warned it was Brits’ “last chance to keep our democracy” because if we vote to Remain we would be “settling for whatever crumbs Angela Merkel was willing to drop.”But in a frantic last day’s campaigning a clearly exhausted Boris Johnson was the champion for the Brexit cause.Despite a two-hour live TV debate on Tuesday night the former Mayor of London was up before dawn to start his 500 mile whirlwind campaign tour by car, plane and helicopter.He began at Billingsgate fish market in London he shook hands and posed for selfies with traders who backed his stance on a Brexit - in part because of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy.He posed with a salmon offered by a fish porter.As photographers urged him to kiss the fish he revealed he had “once kissed a crocodile in Australia”.He drove to Maldon, Essex where he had time to buy a copy of the Sun on a walk through the town.He told activists: “I do think we are on the verge, possibly, of an extraordinary event in the history of our country and indeed in the whole of Europe.”Lorry drivers hooted their horns in support as he met locals in Ashby-de-la Zouch in Leicestershire before he visited Wolverhampton.He then flew to Selby in Yorkshire, landing by helicopter at Burn airfield, a former WWII site for Bomber Command.On descent he quipped “Let’s put on Ride of the Valkyries” in a reference to a classic scene from the film Apocalyspe Now.Speaking to the Sun among a wall of well wishers wanting photos, the man critics claim is only in the campaign for his own political career insisted his passion for the cause had only grown since he came out for a Brexit in February.He confirmed separately yesterday to the BBC that at one stage he had written two letters to the PM -one backing Remain and the other a Brexit, the one he eventually sent.But he told the Sun he had only become “more certain” a Brexit was the right thing to do the longer the campaign has gone on.And he urged Brits to consider what would happen if we vote to Remain.He said: “We will be locked to a system that can only get worse.“We will forever be subservient to a supra-natioal, federalist state.”Dismissing Downing Street’s arguments a Brexit was a leap into the dark, he said it was a “stride into the light”.“There’s a great sunlit meadow out there.“We have just got to open the door.”Batting off criticism the Leave campaign was anti-immigrant, he said he loved immigration and Britain’s multi-cultural society, but Britain had to take back control, and he reassured Sun readers he firmly believed net migration of 184,000 EU nationals a year was far too high.He promised a vote to leave the EU would see immigration fall by the end of the current Parliament.Pulling a pint at the end of the day in the George Pub at Piercebridge, Co Durham he urged supporters to “drive for the line”.Asked about his own stamina, he smiled: “Hard as nails.”As he played barman, Mr Gove in Bournemouth said all the evidence suggested millions of voters were still to make up their minds.And he said: “I get the impression there are some people who believe we should leave the European Union but their’s is a quiet and polite patriotism.“I think you’ve got to take this opportunity to take this once in a lifetime opportunity to leave because if we vote to remain I don’t think we’ll be in a stronger position to reform the European Union.”With him, Tory rising star Penny Mordaunt insisted Brexit supporters should not be made to “feel guilty” or be told they are “narrow minded little Islanders”.She said: “That is quite wrong — these people believe in their country, they believe in what it is capable of if it has the freedom that it needs to thrive.“This is an attempt to make people feel guilty about what they know in their hearts and their heads is the right thing for them and their families and it is a sign that they have lost the arguments.”0445: Leaves home in London drives to Billingsgate (5 miles)0515: Tours Billingsgate fish market -

Boost for Leave after head of German industry says EU would be ‘very, very foolish’ to erect tariffs on the UK after a Brexit2016-6-22GERMANY would be "very, very foolish" to erect tariffs on the UK after a Brexit said the head of the country's industry body in a boost to the Leave campaign’s economic argument.Boris Johnson seized on the remarks by Markus Kerber, and said the country would be "desperate" for free trade with Britain if voters choose to quit Brussels in tomorrow’s referendum.The Tory said any taxes on British exports to Germany would represent a "regression to times we thought we'd left behind in the 1970s".Mr Kerber, the head of the BDI, or federation of German industries, urged his country and the EU to draw up a free-trade regime that could operate after Brexit.He said if the UK left it would be like a relative leaving the family and lead to "serious disruption" in the German-UK economic relationship.Speaking to the BBC's World Service he said: "Imposing trade barriers, imposing protectionist measures between our two countries - or between the two political centres, the European Union on the one hand and the UK on the other - would be a very, very foolish thing in the 21st century."The BDI would urge politicians on both sides to come up with a trade regime that enables us to uphold and maintain the levels of trade we have, although it will become more difficult."Mr Johnson told a BBC debate on Tuesday night that EU countries would be "insane" to erect trade barriers against the UK if it pulled out of the union, using the specific example of Germany.Responding to Mr Kerber's comments on Wednesday, the Tory MP said: "After the incessant doom-mongering of the In campaign, we now hear the truth from the 'voice of German industry' - that they would be desperate for free trade after we Vote Leave."Of course EU countries will continue trading with us on a tariff-free basis - they would be damaging their own commercial interests if they didn't.“That's why EU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal on Friday."As Sir James Dyson said today, this is the last opportunity to regain control of our futures."If we want to take back control and a more secure and more prosperous future, we have to Vote Leave on June 23."

How will Brexit affect the economy and house prices?2016-6-21GEORGE Osborne has been peddling doom and gloom with his predictions for what will happen if Britain votes to leave the European Union.With his Project Fear mantra he claims the outlook for the British economy will be very bleak after Brexit.He says chaos and uncertainty could send the pound plummeting by 15% and government borrowing up by £39bn.And he has said families would be £4,300 a year worse off with Brexit.The Treasury’s short term impact report predicts 820,000 jobs will be lost and the average wage will sink by 4%, or between £800 and £1,400 a year.And the document suggests a vote for Brexit will wipe 6% off GDP and tip the UK into a year-long recession.But his nightmare scenario has been blasted by Brexiteers and questioned by the cross-party House of Commons Treasury Select Committee.The Treasury report says people would lose money with Brexit but economist Gerard Lyons says not even their own figures showed that.It expects the economy to be much bigger by 2030 than it is now, no matter how Britain votes in the EU referendum.But instead of reporting it this way the Treasury said the economy would be 6.2 per cent smaller with Brexit than if we remained in.Even so, Dr Lyons said that would still leave the UK economy almost 30 per cent larger with Brexit by 2030 than it is now.And the member of Economists for Brexit said the Government’s financial predictions are based on pessimistic assumptions about future policy including if we were to leave the EU we would not change our migration or regulation policy.Dr Lyons also said the Treasury has miscalculated the figure, and the Chancellor’s £4,300 loss per household should be reported as a long-term gain for each of us.George Osborne has warned house prices may fall by 18% if Britain votes for BrexitHe said it would be a lose-lose situation because despite homes being cheaper he claims it would be more difficult for first time buyers to get mortgages.And he says mortgage rates would go up.But Brexit-backing Cabinet minister Chris Grayling says voting to stay in the EU would make it difficult for people to get on the housing ladder – and even to be able to afford to rent a home.He says it is simple maths because if we cannot set limits on the numbers of people coming to Britain then it will make it more difficult for people to afford their own home.The Leader of the House of Commons says the more people trying to find homes, the more expensive they will be.And Lord Andrew Green, the chairman of Migration Watch UK, says at the present rate of immigration we have to build one home every four minutes to house migrants and their families.He says a vote to Remain will mean our ongoing housing crisis will only get worse.Remain campaigners say if Britain leaves the European Union then EU states would slap tariffs on us.And David Cameron says he was absolutely convinced the UK economy would suffer if we did vote to leave.But the Prime Minister has admitted that the EU’s share of global trade has fallen since Britain signed up for the Common Market in the early 1970s.If Britain was outside the European Union it would be free to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world – as well as the EU.Mr Cameron admits the UK desperately needs a trade deal with India, as we currently export more ‘services’ to tiny Luxembourg than one of the fastest growing economies in the entire world.Brexit-backers say Britain would thrive if it was allowed to negotiate trade deals outside of Brussels.Tory MEP and Out campaigner Dan Hannan says it is scaremongering of the Remain campaign to suggest EU states would impose tariffs on Britain.At the minute Britain is a great customer, buying £291billion of EU goods each year, more than the £240billion we sell to other EU states.Leave campaigners say the EU would not want to jeopardise this trade by bringing in tariffs.The Treasury dossier mapped up two different Brexit scenarios – ‘Shock’ and ‘Severe Shock’ – depending on whether Britain could cut a new trade deal with the EU within the mandated two year deadline.Mr Osborne is hoping Britain votes to stay in the EU so businesses can keep trading in the single market – and says this is the best way to keep the economy stable.This means countries can trade with each other without restrictions or tariffs.If Britain does vote to leave the EU then a trade deal would need to be thrashed out so we can keep exporting our goods to Europe, and they can sell goods back to us.But Brexiteer Boris Johnson says there is no need to be in the single market to export to it.Since the start of the single market in 1993 he says 36 countries – including the USA, India, New Zealand, Canada, and Brazil – have done better at exporting to the EU single market without being in it.And if Britain does leave the EU then it would be able to negotiate trade deals not just with the EU but countries all over the world.Among the business people who back Boris’s view are two of Britain’s biggest names – the man who reinvented everyday devices such as vacuum cleaners and hand dryers Sir James Dyson, and Lord Anthony Bamford  from JCB.Lord Bamford says there is ‘little to fear’ by quitting the EU and Sir James says the bloc is dominated by Germany and does not want to champion new technologies.

Cake firm boss leads legion of businesses calling for country to leave Europe2016-6-19THIRTY-SEVEN top business chiefs led by cake-chain boss Luke Johnson today call on Britain to quit the “energy-sapping” EU.Mr Johnson, who runs the French-style cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, and the other high-flyers are backing Brexit ahead of Thursday’s referendum.The self-starters claim small firms will thrive once freed from the Brussels “straitjacket”.In a letter to The Sun on Sunday, they warn the eurozone destroys “white van man” style enterprises.Their intervention is a major boost for the Brexit campaign as the In/Out vote approaches.The 37 entrepreneurs have all become major market players after turning an original idea or a small family firm into top wealth-creators, outperforming FTSE 100 giants.They say: “This was achieved in spite of the EU, not because of it.” Mr Johnson, 54, turned Pizza Express from a chain of 12 restaurants to more than 250 today before taking on Patisserie Valerie.Lined up with him for Brexit are Superdrug founder Peter Goldstein, Toby Baxendale of Direct Seafoods and James Tanner of Tanners Wine.John Mills of retail promotions firm JML and Stuart Wheeler of finance company IG have also thrown their weight behind the move. Their letter adds: “We’re confident that, unburdened by the energy-sapping European project, British inventiveness, flexibility and thoroughness will see the country thrive outside the EU.“These attributes will ensure that our economic performance continues to outstrip that of the rest of the EU bloc.”Mr Johnson said: “The EU lacks democracy. This legislation and regulation it likes to create isn’t good for job creation.”Mr Goldstein, who founded Superdrug with his brother Ronald in 1964, claims the EU “stifles growth”.He said: “Since we joined, slowly, slowly, slowly, we have lost our power base. The end game is to be where we were — a free, independent and democratic country.” [scribd id=316106361 key=key-1stKvVbg3Paq10Us2qjX mode=scroll]

Boris Johnson gives his vision of post-Brexit Britain in rallying cry for independence2016-6-19BULLISH Boris Johnson last night outlined his vision of a post-Brexit Britain and declared: “This is our moment.”The Tory MP said people have nothing to fear by “backing ourselves” and voting to leave the EU on Thursday.And he revealed the immediate steps he would take to break the nation free from the shackles he says have held us back for 40 years.In a rallying call, he said: “This is it now. Let’s do this thing.“Later this week we’ll have a once in a lifetime opportunity. This is our moment when the British people take centre stage in history.“The eyes of Europe will be on us and hundreds of millions of people will be praying that we do the right thing and vote for change.This is our moment when the British people take centre stage“If we do this, we’ll be speaking up for democracy not only in Britain but throughout Europe and it will be a fine thing that will echo through the ages.”Mr Johnson said several of the worst EU ties could be broken off within days — even before talks about full withdrawal have started.His first action would be to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, putting full rule of law back into the hands of our own judges.Next he would make preparations for the return of our annual contributions, leaving millions of pounds more for British ministers to spend.Seizing back control of our borders would be the third major act, with a points-based immigration system devised that would be fair to people from across the world.But BoJo insisted the first and most crucial act in the hours after Brexit is to make clear and cogent statements about Britain’s new place in Europe.The most important thing first of all is that David Cameron should stay on as Prime MinisterThe former London Mayor said: “The most important thing first of all is that David Cameron should stay on as Prime Minister — and I am sure he will.“He will need to send a very powerful message to our European friends and partners that this is not a vote against Europe. It will be a vote against the institutions of the European Union.“Britain must send a powerful signal that we remain committed to partnership and friendship with our friends and partners and that should be done very soon.”Steps towards full divorce from the EU could be taken “fairly rapidly”, he added, without starting the full exit process by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.Mr Johnson gave a glimpse of the changes ahead as he launched into the last lap of the referendum campaign, following a three-day suspension due to the killing of MP Jo Cox.He will criss-cross the country in a helicopter to get across his message to undecided voters.This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take back control of our democracy from an unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable and unreformed European UnionOn polling day, he will be in Scotland attending his daughter Lara’s graduation ceremony before returning to London. In an exclusive interview with The Sun on Sunday, he said: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take back control of our democracy from an unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable and unreformed European Union.“We are working flat out to achieve this. It’s a chance to take back control of huge sums of money and to take back control of our trade policy. There’s a massive opportunity for Britain. We should be full of excitement and hope about what can be achieved.“This country has never gone wrong by believing in itself and trusting in its democratic institutions.“That is what is at stake. This week is about whether we believe in British democracy or are content to see it steadily eroded and lost to unaccountable, unelected people overseas.”Mr Johnson insisted the Tory party — and the country — can pull back together again once the matter has been settled.Though insisting Mr Cameron should stay as PM, he warned him against axing fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove from the Cabinet. “David has my full confidence,” he stressed. “Don’t forget I was one of the first people to back him for the leadership in 2005.This week is about whether we believe in British democracy or are content to see it steadily eroded and lost to unaccountable, unelected people overseas“He was the best person for the job then and he is now. I think he will survive, whatever the outcome. There are a lot of people signing letters saying they want him to stay on — and Michael Gove as well.“In these campaigns, you always expect things to get energetic from time to time. But people need to get back together again and continue a one-nation Conservative agenda.”Mr Johnson, who is expected to get a Cabinet post in the next reshuffle, said his own future was irrelevant.He also defended the heavy focus on immigration by the Leave campaign and blamed free movement partly for the rise of extremism.He said: “As you know, I’m pro-immigration. I’m the proud descendant of Turks. My family is like a genetic version of a UN peace-keeping force.“We come from everywhere, but I believe passionately that people should become British and also that you should have a policy that is fair and balanced.There is nothing to be afraid of. There will be no giant earthquake on Friday morning“The other reason for taking back control is that I don’t like extremism. I don’t like the far-Right parties that you see coming up across Europe.“I am a very moderate liberal Conservative but I think that the problem with immigration is that politicians have promised they can control it when legally they can’t because we are in the EU. You can only spike the guns of the extremists and the people who are genuinely anti-immigrant if you take back control.”He added: “There is nothing to be afraid of. There will be no giant earthquake on Friday morning.“The only economic outcome you will see is that people on low wages will gradually get a pay rise.“Sun on Sunday readers won’t go wrong believing in Britain, as I know they do. The fundamental question is, do we trust ourselves to govern ourselves or do we want to be increasingly run by people we don’t elect?“This is a great opportunity and it would be a shame if we missed it. That’s why I will be out there this week telling everybody the same message: ‘We can do it. Let’s do it’.”

Murder of MP Jo Cox is being treated as ‘terror related’, court hears as her ‘killer’ is remanded in custody2016-6-20THE murder of Labour MP Jo Cox is being treated as a terror-related crime, the Old Bailey heard today.Tommy Mair, 52, appeared in court via videolink accused of shooting Mrs Cox, 41, dead as she made her way to meet with constituents.He is said to have knifed the MP for Batley and Spen as she got out of her car at 12.45pm on Thursday before shooting her three times with a modified rifle.Appearing via video link, Mair spoke only to confirm his name during the 10-minute hearing.There was no application for bail and Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned the case for a preliminary hearing on Thursday morning at 10am.The case will be heard on that day by Mr Justice Saunders as part of his list of terror-related cases.The mum-of-two was the first sitting MP to be killed since Tory Ian Gow was blown up by the IRA in 1990.Death to traitors, freedom for BritainAt an initial hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Saturday, Mair wore a grey prison issue tracksuit.He gave his name as “Death to traitors, freedom for Britain”.Judge Arbuthnot, deputy chief magistrate for England and Wales, replied: “Pardon, sorry?”Mair then repeated the name. After a long pause, the clerk then asked for his date of birth and home address, but he said nothing.It has emerged Mrs Cox was planning to warn of an increase in anti-Muslim attacks before her tragic death.Witnesses to the savage killing said the attacker shouted, “Britain first, keep Britain independent, Britain always comes first, this is for Britain”.Politicians from all parties have united in grief to pay tribute to Mrs Cox since her death.Prime Minister David Cameron described her as a "rising star" who "had a big heart" and was a "caring and committed MP".While Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party had lost a "much-loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for social justice and peace".Today MPs returned to the House of Commons to remember Mrs Cox after being recalled during recess for the EU referendum.It's after all major political parties agreed not to contest the upcoming by-election to elect an MP to Mrs Cox's seat.But an ex-BNP member has announced he plans to fight to replace the murdered MP.23-year-old Jack Buckby, 23, said he will contest the Batley and Spen by-election - forcing shocked local Labour members to campaign in the area despite their grief.Mair, a gardener, is also charged with causing grievous bodily harm to Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, who was also allegedly attacked at the same time as Mrs Cox.The full bravery of retired miner Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, has been revealed for the first time.He was stabbed in the abdomen as he tried to save mum-of-two Mrs Cox from her killer.The attacker was carrying ammunition, a modified .22 rifle with sawn-off barrel and a knife close to the scene.Just three days after Mrs Cox's death, her husband revealed he took their children camping to remember their mother who "loved sleeping under the stars".The outpouring of love to our family has been humbling. Thank you. And for supporting her causes https://t.co/l16ZrFmhw3 #MoreInCommonGrieving Brendan Cox has also set up a GoFundMe page in the wake of her death, which has raised more than £800,000 for three of her favourite charities: the Royal Voluntary Service, which helps to combat loneliness in her West Yorkshire constituency; the White Helmets, volunteer search and rescue workers in Syria; and Hope Not Hate, which seeks to challenge hate and extremism in local communities across the UK.Mrs Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater paid tribute to her "perfect" sibling in an emotional statement on Saturday.She said: “Over the last 48 hours, people have not been silent. They have been vocal and passionate and have spoken from the heart. Genuine emotion with no hidden agenda."Jo would have loved it. We have to continue this strength and solidarity for the days, months and years to come as part of Jo’s legacy."To focus on that which unites us and not which divides us.”At court on Saturday, Mair did not enter a plea and his lawyer Keith Allen said there was no indication what plea would be given.Today, grey-bearded Mair, wearing beige trousers and a white long-sleeved t-shirt, replied "yes I am" when asked to confirm his name.He has a history of mental health problems, and Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot ordered he be assessed by a psychiatrist as the investigation continues.Mair is said to have taken up gardening as part of his treatment for his psychiatric problems.Mair, of Birstall, West Yorkshire. is due back in court on June 23 for a preliminary hearing, and is currently being held in top security jail HMP Belmarsh in southeast London.We pay for your stories!

Prime Minister’s former ‘guru’ Steve Hilton says David Cameron knew his election pledge to cut immigration was impossible YEARS ago2016-6-21DAVID Cameron knew his target to cut immigration to "tens of thousands" was impossible for four years but continued to make the pledge, one of his closest former aides claimed last night.Steve Hilton - who attended top-level meetings with the Prime Minister - said civil servants directly warned the PM he was on mission impossible because EU rules insist on the free movement of people.But despite being told in 2012 it was a no-go, he said Mr Cameron repeated the promise - even including it in his general election manifesto last year.In an interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Hilton said: "We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it."Just weeks ago the PM insisted he stuck by his ''ambition'' of bringing net migration into the UK - which last month hit 333,000.Mr Hilton added: "You don't need to sit in a 'stock take' meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we're in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it."In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable."When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave."For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what (Michael) Gove and (Boris) Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics."The policy guru, who is godfather to one of the PM’s kids, also attacks leading Remain campaigner George Osborne.He says the Chancellor and the “political elite” are “playing with fire” by demonising the public’s desire for control over our borders and destiny.Mr Hilton writes: “Our broken immigration system is a social disaster because the decency and tolerance of the British people, virtues that our politicians so love to talk about when it suits them, are mocked when they see their local communities and public services overwhelmed by sudden and unplanned-for arrivals of people in large numbers — the kind of dramatic changes which, needless to say, don’t affect the neighbourhoods inhabited by our insular ruling elite.”He adds: “There’s a broader argument here, too, because the EU debate isn’t just about immigration, which is why it is so offensive for the Remain campaign to argue, as George Osborne put it, that those like me who want to leave the EU ‘want a meaner, narrower Britain’.“The fact is that with areas such as the economy, the environment, our legal system — which affect people’s everyday lives in Britain — membership of the EU makes it impossible for the elected government to govern our country in the true sense of the word.“It seems to me that here in Britain, and especially in this referendum campaign, our insular ruling elite is playing with fire.”Mr Hilton, who describes himself as an immigrant, finishes by saying: “By dismissing - or worse, demonising - people’s desire for control over the things that matter to them, and their perfectly reasonable expectation that the government they elect should have the power to deliver its promises, the rulers are the ones stoking the anger they decry.“Undeliverable promises.

Murdered MP Jo Cox pictured one day before her death giving a talk to school kids in her constituency2016-6-17JO Cox inspires the next generation as she gives a talk to pupils — barely a day before she was gunned down in the street.Labour MP Jo addressed a class of school kids on the EU referendum at Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton, West Yorks, on Wednesday.The image, posted to her Twitter account, would be one of the final images of a tragic young mum devoted to public service.In a caption under the photo, she wrote: "The #EUref debate @WMount in Cleckheaton was excellent. Lots of interest and great questions from students #Remain."A day later she would lay dead after a horrific attack at the hands of a barbaric gun and knife attack following an advice surgery in her constituency of Batley and Spen.Murder suspect Tommy Mair is in police custody today after the attack during which the MP was shot in head three times before being stabbed at least seven times with a foot-long knife.The father of her assistant Fazila Aswat - who with with Jo as she lay dying in the street - spoke about her final words on Friday.Gulham Maniyar told ITV News: "She was with my daughter. They'd left Batley office, they were in the marketplace, she was in my daughter's car sitting in the back seat. The car stopped and Jo decided to come out. "My daughter didn't know she'd been shot. Because this person must be waiting outside where the surgery happens."She said her [Jo's] injury was so bad and she was in her arms. There was lots of blood. She said 'Jo, get up' but she [Jo] said 'no, my pain is too much, Fazila'."I think those were the last words Jo spoke. She could not do anything else. She tried to comfort her. "Then the police came, the air ambulance came, they took her to hospital. She was a witness and her clothes were full of blood."Details also emerged about how 52-year-old loner Mair - a  longstanding supporter of a neo-Nazi group - had bought a manual that gave instructions on how to build a gun.PM David Cameron, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Commons Speaker John Bercow laid flowers at a memorial to the murdered MP in Birstall, near Leeds, on Friday.While Downing Street confirmed the Conservatives would not contest the by-election that will be triggered by her death.The final days of Jo's life - posted to her Twitter page - detail her commitment to the community in her Yorkshire seat.On Tuesday the mother of two children, aged three and five, spoke with local kids at the Batley Parish School, where she talked to youngsters about their aspirations.The snap catches Jo standing in front of the engrossed children while she poses questions to them during school assembly.She wrote alongside the picture: "Led the assembly at the wonderful Batley Parish School, we focused on good citizenship, democracy and aspiration."Only one day earlier she met with MacMillan Cancer Support staff, working in the local community to help those affected by the disease.Later that day she visited staff at a chippy that is now offering gluten-free fish and chips to customers.And last week the 41-year-old highlighted the work done by local church-goers in the community.Tributes to Jo continued to pour in on Friday as neighbours of the couple's London boat said her husband Brendan was "in bits".Anne Wainwright chair of the Heritage Moorings said: "I spoke to Jo's husband Brendan last night and we've exchanged some messages."He's obviously in bits, I can't imagine what he's going through. And her parents as well, it's so terrible, we're in such shock."Brendan had last night spoken about how his family would never recover from the loss of Jo, as he posted a poignant last photo of his wife.He wrote: "Today is the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. More difficult, more painful, less joyful, less full of love."I and Jo’s friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo."Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it everyday of her life with an energy, and a zest for life that would exhaust most people."She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her.”Her parents Gordon and Jean Leadbeater spoke of their shock from the family's home in Roberttown, West Yorks, on Friday.Gordon said: "It's too early yet, we're still in shock so not yet."We pay for your stories!

Conservative think-tank puts pressure on David Cameron to call ‘attachment’ to notion of free movement into question2016-6-18A TORY think tank backed by senior Ministers heaped pressure on David Cameron last night by joining calls to review “antiquated” EU immigration rules.Bright Blue said Brussels lawmakers had to “face reality” and revise free movement legislation which allows all EU nationals to come to the UK to live and work as they please.And it said the EU’s “stubborn attachment” to the principle was shattering public support.The think tank is a “modernising” group which counts Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and former Trade Minister Francis Maude on its advisory board.Bright Blue director Ryan Shorthouse said: “My personal view is that we should remain in the EU.“But a considerable proportion of the population will have voted to leave in the EU referendum, largely because of the inability to control the number of people migrating to our country.“The EU must face reality and learn the lessons of this flirtation with Brexit: the free movement of people is unsustainable in a growing bloc which contains countries with such diverse living standards.”He added: “There needs to be a meaningful review and revision of this antiquated principle to lessen the huge flow of people across Europe, a phenomenon which is unfair to both richer and poorer member states.”The intervention comes just three days after Theresa May revealed the first cracks in the Government’s stance on immigration policy.The Home Secretary said “we should look at further reform in the future” just hours after Chancellor George Osborne dismissed the suggestion out of hand.The split came 24 hours after Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson plunged his party into chaos by making a shock call for curbs to Brussels’ free movement laws – which give all EU nationals to live and work in Britain.Downing Street was forced on Tuesday night dismiss claims it may offer controls on free movement in a last-ditch bid to win over voters in next week’s Referendum.Official figures in May showed net migration hit a whopping 333,000 last year – with net migration from EU countries at 184,000.We pay for your stories!

David Cameron hits back at former top aide Steve Hilton in row over immigration2016-6-21A MAJOR public row over immigration has exploded between the PM and his Brexit backing former “guru” Steve Hilton.The former No 10 aide claimed that David Cameron was told by civil servants “directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU.”But the PM hit back on TV, saying: “It’s simply not right.”The furious Premier lashed out: “Actually when Steve Hilton left Downing Street in 2012, net immigration had actually fallen quite substantially and it got down to 154,000, so not far away from the ambition that I set.”The latest row is the most vicious between the pair, who have been close political allies since the 1990s but are now trading bitter Brexit blows. Just weeks ago Mr Cameron insisted he stuck by his “ambition” of bringing net migration into the UK — which last month hit 333,000 — below 100,000.Downing Street said they “did not recognise” Mr Hilton’s account of the meeting.But Vote Leave backing Steve Hilton said the PM made the pledge at the 2015 general election even though he “had been told was undeliverable”.Mr Hilton added: “You don’t need to sit in a ‘stock take’ meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we’re in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it.“In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable.“When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave,” he added.“For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what Michael Gove and Boris Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics.”Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if he and his party had campaigned on a “lie” at the last election, Michael Gove said: “No I did not. I believed and hoped that we would be able to secure a deal with Europe which would enable us to amend free movement.”Tonight Brexit backing Tory MPs called on the PM to scrap the controversial pledge.Speaking on the Vote Leave battle bus  former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said: “It is not possible to control migration from within the EU.”He added: “If we vote to Remain on Thursday, the Conservatives must drop the pledge we made at the election as it would be dishonest to maintain the pretence that the issue was within our control.”The row came as respected think tank Migration Watch claimed that “overseas students from outside the EU who stay on indefinitely in the UK” are hugely inflating net migration figures.They said that there was “no evidence of departure” for over 100,000 a year.The group’s chairman Lord Green of Deddington said: “In all the talk about the government failing to reduce non-EU migration, the question of the vanishing students has been overlooked.“The government have postponed, until after the referendum, the publication of the first information about the exit checks which came into effect in April 2015.”He added: “They must be used to identify the culprit colleges and achieve the enforcement that is long overdue.”

MPs place roses in Jo Cox’s empty Commons seat as parents grieve at Parliament memorial2016-6-20MPs placed a red and white rose in Jo Cox's empty seat in the House of Commons today as Jeremy Corbyn led tributes to the murdered MP.The Labour leader said her slaughter last week was an "attack on our whole democracy" in what appeared to be "an act of extreme political violence" in tearful scenes in Parliament today.In a gesture of cross-party solidarity, Prime Minister David gave way to the Labour leader to speak first as Parliament was recalled to honour the fallen MP who would have turned 42 on Wednesday.With Mrs Cox's parents, children and husband looking on, Mr Corbyn told a silent House of Commons: "We have lost one of our own and our society has lost one of our very best."She spent her life serving and campaigning for other people - whether as a worker for Oxfam or for the anti-slavery charity the Freedom Fund, as a political activist and as a feminist."The horrific act that took her from us was an attack on democracy, and our whole country has been shocked and saddened by it.He added : "In her tragic death we can come together to change our politics. To tolerate a little more and condemn a little less."The PM said Mrs Cox had been a "loving determined passionate and progressive politician who epitomised the best of humanity".He said: "We are here today to remember an extraordinary colleague and friend. Jo Cox was a voice of compassion whose irrepressible spirit and boundless energy lit up the lives of all who knew her, and saved the lives of many she never, ever met."Today we grieve her loss, and we hold in our hearts and prayers her husband Brendan, her parents and sister, and her two children who are just three and five years-old."We express our anger at the sickening and despicable attack that killed her as she did her job serving her constituents on the streets of Birstall."Commons Speaker John Bercow had agreed to recall MPs to allow members to commemorate a colleague described as "perfect" by her family. The Lords also returned today.The Speaker said MPs were meeting in "heartbreaking sadness" and "heartfelt solidarity" and condemned her killing as an attack on "our freedom".Male MPs from all sides wore the white rose of Yorkshire as a button hole and women donned colourful scarves in Mrs Cox's honour.Her husband Brendan, two young children and Mrs Cox's parents watched proceedings from the public gallery.Mrs Cox's three-year-old daughter Lejla played with a drawing board on her dad's knee throughout the service while Cuillin, five, cuddled his grandmother.MPs recalled a "bundle of energy and brains" often seen striding through Westminster in cycling gear, rushing home to put her three and five-year-old children to bed.Former Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves broke down in tears as she paid tribute to her friend of 10 years."Batley and Spen will elect another MP, but no-one can replace a mother," she said as she was comforted by colleagues.Family friend Stephen Kinnock, who shared an office with Mrs Cox, said his former colleague would have reacted with "outrage" at the divisive Leave.EU poster released last week.Mr Kinnock said the nation must follow the words of Mrs Cox's husband Brendan and "fight against the hatred that killed Jo".He added: "In the name of Jo Cox and all that is decent we must not let this atrocity intimidate our democracy."We must now work to build a more respectful and united country because this is our time to honour the legacy of the proud Yorkshire lass who dedicated her life to the common good and who was so cruelly taken away from us in the prime of her life."Jo Cox: We love you, we salute you and we shall never forget you."Mr Cox tweeted after the hour-long session:Thank you to the whole House& staff for your kindness& compassion to our family today & for describing so well the Jo we love #MoreInCommonAfter almost an hour of tributes from MPs on all sides of the political divide, members broke parliamentary convention and gave Mrs Cox a standing ovation before making their way to St Margaret’s Church opposite parliament for a memorial service.After the service MPs and Mrs Cox's parents flocked to a memorial in Parliament Square where mourners have piled flowers in recent days.Gordon and Jean Leadbeater held each other close as they read some of the cards left in the amongst the floral tributes on the grass outside Parliament.The killing of the 41-year-old MP outside the public library in Birstall in her West Yorkshire constituency has prompted an outpouring of public grief.MPs have praised her passionate commitment to causes such as the plight of Syrian refugees and her ability to work with colleagues on all sides of the House.Local people have paid tribute to her infectious enthusiasm and tireless efforts on behalf of her constituents.A memorial fund to raise money for charities she supported has reached almost £900,000.Prayers were said on Sunday for Mr Cox's husband Brendan and their children at a service at St Peter's Church, less than half a mile from where she died.The Rev Paul Knight told the congregation: "Her humanity was powerful and compelling and we would do well to recognise her as an amazing example - a 21st century Good Samaritan."Mr Knight said: "Jo was someone who went out of her way to help others. I regret to say I didn't know what she was like as a girl but she grew into a fervent advocate for the poor and oppressed."And though she must have been angry at times about what she saw here and around the world - those places she visited and worked - she seemed to me, at least, to be one who could fight with a passion and a disarming smile."The MP and former aid worker will also be honoured with an album of live music from Glastonbury festival, with the likes of Coldplay and Muse agreeing to contribute songs from their upcoming sets to the album.Oxfam Presents: Stand As One - Live at Glastonbury 2016 is a first-of-its-kind live album in support of the charity’s work with refugees worldwide.Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB chief executive, said it would now be made in memory of the Labour MP, who was a former Oxfam activist and who was killed on June 16.He said: "Given Jo's tireless work to help refugees both at Oxfam and beyond, it felt appropriate to dedicate the album to her."Glastonbury co-organiser Emily Eavis explained: "We are making this special live album from Glastonbury this summer because the scale of the refugee crisis is so huge we simply had to do something."We want people who are far from home and frightened to know we are doing whatever we can to help."To know the artists who play here are doing whatever they can. To know the people who love their music are doing whatever they can."Now it's time for world leaders to do the same. All of us - Glastonbury, Oxfam, musicians and music-lovers everywhere - must Stand As One to demand action for refugees."Sigur Ros, The Last Shadow Puppets, Chvrches, Wolf Alice, Laura Mvula, Jamie Lawson, The 1975, Editors, Years & Years and Fatboy Slim are also confirmed for the album - with more expected to join.

EU laws mean Theresa May has to beg the courts to kick an Italian killer out of Britain2016-6-21THERESA May was today forced to beg the courts to boot out a brutal Italian killer allowed to stay in the UK by “mad” EU laws.In a desperate last ditch bid, the Home Secretary urged judges to overturn an order from 2012 blocking the deportation of a convicted criminal known only as ‘FV’.The Italian national was convicted of the manslaughter of his flatmate Edward Mitchell in 2002 after striking him around the head 20 times with weapons including a hammer.He also strangled him with the flex from an iron.The charge was reduced to manslaughter for reasons of provocation.But after being released from prison the Home Office was told four years ago that he could not be deported as it was “unlawful” under EU free movement law – giving him a right to citizenship and permanent residence having built up a life in Britain.This is despite him breaching a suspended sentence for “battery” just months before.Brexit-backing Justice Minister Dominic Raab said the case highlighted the “skewed moral compass” at the heart of EU free movement rules.He blasted: “An EU national convicted of brutally killing someone in this country, by hammering and strangling them to death, can’t be removed on the basis of the conviction by a UK court.“It’s dangerous and undemocratic.”He added that David Cameron in opposition had slammed the legal position as “complete madness”. And he said: “The Prime Minister is absolutely right.“The only way to restore some sanity is to vote leave and take back control of our borders.”A judgement from the Supreme Court is not expected until long after Thursday’s Referendum.But it comes just two weeks after the Brexit campaign published a dossier of 50 killers Britain has been prevented from deporting because of EU free movement laws giving EU nationals the right to stay in the UK.One was convicted murderer Learco Chindamo was murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence in 1995 when he went to help a 13 year-old boy who was being attacked.In 2007 Justice Collins said removing Chindamo would be “disproportionate” under EU law. At the time, then opposition leader David Cameron said: “This does seem to be complete madness.”Government sources yesterday claimed the Home Office is challenging the 2012 verdict to argue that a prison sentence should be treated as a period out of the UK – thereby breaking his right to residence.The Italian – ‘FV’ – was sentenced to 8 years in prison in 2002. He had previous convictions for assault on police, drunk driving and driving while disqualified.He was released to hostel accommodation in 2006, but as no place was available, he received £25,000-worth of damages for the unlawful imprisonment which followed.

PM claims Brexit will slap extra £200 on motorists’ fuel bills2016-6-20BREXIT could slap an extra £200 a year on drivers’ fuel pump bills, David Cameron last night claimed.The PM told The Sun that leaving the EU will spark a sharp drop in the value of the Pound by as much as 20 per cent.That will ramp the cost to garage owners of importing petrol and diesel, which they will pass on to consumers, and Sun readers will suffer the most.Mr Cameron claimed: “It could put £200 on a typical fuel bill for the year for someone driving a Ford Focus.“If the pound goes down, the cost of petrol goes up.”In a bid to flag up the risks of Brexit to ordinary people’s pockets, the PM added: “My worry is that the people who will be hit the hardest by leaving the EU are hardworking Sun readers, who want to support their families.“That is just one aspect of where people who not necessarily on high wages are the most at risk of an exit where we see the economy shrink, opportunities go down and we lose jobs.”Last month, Leave campaign boss Boris Johnson insisted Brexit would have the opposite effect on fuel prices by liberating.Breaking free from Brussels would the end EU’s “stranglehold” on our pumps by letting the British government slash VAT on fuel below the current 15 per cent floor set by Brussels.But the PM hit back at the ex-Tory London Mayor’s promise to brand it “fantasy” economics”.Mr Cameron said: “They have spent this money, which does not exist by the way, ten times over.“If we leave the EU there is no saving. There is a cost.”Even the Leave campaign’s own economist Andrew Lilico has admitted the cost to the British economy of leaving the EU in the short term will be £60bn, or a 2% hit to GDP, Mr Cameron also insisted.He added: “And there is also no way back.“If you take that risk in a general election, you can change your mind in five years’ time and you can chuck the team you have elected out.“If we take this risk, this is a one way ticket.“Once you have jumped off the diving board you cannot scramble back up onto it.”

David Cameron hits back at former top aide Steve Hilton in row over immigration2016-6-21A MAJOR public row over immigration has exploded between the PM and his Brexit backing former “guru” Steve Hilton.The former No 10 aide claimed that David Cameron was told by civil servants “directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU.”But the PM hit back on TV, saying: “It’s simply not right.”The furious Premier lashed out: “Actually when Steve Hilton left Downing Street in 2012, net immigration had actually fallen quite substantially and it got down to 154,000, so not far away from the ambition that I set.”The latest row is the most vicious between the pair, who have been close political allies since the 1990s but are now trading bitter Brexit blows. Just weeks ago Mr Cameron insisted he stuck by his “ambition” of bringing net migration into the UK — which last month hit 333,000 — below 100,000.Downing Street said they “did not recognise” Mr Hilton’s account of the meeting.But Vote Leave backing Steve Hilton said the PM made the pledge at the 2015 general election even though he “had been told was undeliverable”.Mr Hilton added: “You don’t need to sit in a ‘stock take’ meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we’re in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it.“In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable.“When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave,” he added.“For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what Michael Gove and Boris Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics.”Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if he and his party had campaigned on a “lie” at the last election, Michael Gove said: “No I did not.

Widower of MP Jo Cox tweets his reaction to Brexit2016-6-24THE husband of Jo Cox has said his wife “would have remained optimistic and focussed” in the wake of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.Brendan, 37, tweeted this morning as the result came in: “Today Jo wld have remained optimistic and focussed on what she cld do to bring our country back together around our best values.”Today Jo wld have remained optimistic & focussed on what she cld do to bring our country back together around our best values #MoreInCommonHe ended his tweet with #moreincommon – a phrase which has been used by Mr Cox in the wake of his wife’s death.At just after 6am this morning Leave passed the threshold of 16.8million votes needed to trigger a Brexit.The ultra-narrow margin of victory of 52% to 48% left the nation split down the middle.Labour MP Jo had been campaigning to remain as part of the EU before she was stabbed to death in Birstall, West Yorkshire last week.Brendan’s tweet has been retweeted 2,000 times and liked more than 2,200.A day before her death Jo, Brendan and their two young children had taken part in the flotilla on the Thames.She said her family had taken part because “we’re stronger in”.My hubby @MrBrendanCox & children taking part in the battle of the #Thames - because we're #StrongerIn #Remain pic.twitter.com/6JNMnQ4ZfgCharity director Brendan has previously said his wife was murdered because of her “very strong political views”.He said: “She was a politician and she had very strong political views and I believe she was killed because of those views.“I think she died because of them, and she would want to stand up for those in death as much as she did in life.”The MP’s death resulted in both the ‘Remain’ and ‘Leave’ sides suspending their campaigns.Widower Brendan, who was an adviser to former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, says Jo was concerned about the vicious rhetoric coming from both sides of the political divide.He said: “I think she was very worried that the language was coarsening, that people were being driven to take more extreme positions, that people didn’t work with each other as individuals and on issues, it was all much too tribal."Jo became Labour MP for Batley and Spen at last year’s General Election.Brendan added: “She was particularly worried about the direction of politics at the moment, particularly around creating division and playing on people’s worst fears rather than their best instincts.”Events took place all over the world to mark what would have been Jo Cox's 42nd birthday this week.Thomas Mair, 52, who has been charged with her murder, refused to give his name in court saying instead: “Death to traitors, freedom for Britain”. 

JD Wetherspoon prints thousands of new pro-Brexit beer mats attacking George Osborne for EU referendum stance2016-6-20PUB chain JD Wetherspoon is printing thousands of new pro-Brexit beer mats attacking George Osborne over the EU referendum.The company’s founder Tim Martin, who is backing Leave in Thursday’s vote, is sending the Chancellor a series of questions and calling ‘cronyism’ bad for Britain.The firm are printing half a million mats to be sent to its 920 outlets in the final days of campaigning.Signed by Mr Martin, who is also Wetherspoon’s chairman, it reads: "Dear Mr Osborne, You say that you won the economic argument.“Many strongly disagree.”It goes on to say: "Democracy leads to prosperity and freedom - and the EU is increasingly undemocratic, with awful results in Greece, Spain and Portugal and 15 years' stagnation in Italy."Our European friends are being dragged down by Brussels' bureaucracy."Speaking about the beer mats, Mr Martin said: "Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have tried to fool the public using scare stories from cronies or subordinates."Their main economic case relies on these people and their views are not independent or believable."Cameron yet again deliberately uses images of fear and destruction."He is under-estimating the intelligence of the public, who will not swallow this guff."The beer mat takes aim at bodies like the IMF, the OECD and the Bank of England, all of whom have predicted a negative outcome for the economy if there is a vote to leave the EU on Thursday.Mr Martin has previously tried to convince drinkers to back a Brexit after they printed 200,000 beer mats attacking IMF chief Christine Lagarde last month.CRONYISM IS BAD FOR BRITAIN - a few questions for George Osborne:Dear Mr Osborne,You say that you won the economic argument. Many strongly disagree.Democracy leads to prosperity and freedom - and the EU is increasingly undemocratic, with awful results in Greece, Spain and Portugal and 15 years' stagnation in Italy.Our European friends are being dragged down by Brussels' bureaucracy.I think that you are relying too much on cronies, whose organisations did not predict the last downturn and who don't realise what they don't know.You rely on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), HM Treasury and the Bank of England to support the 'Remain' case, yet:1. You officially nominated your friend (in January) Christine Lagarde, as head of the IMF.2. The OECD is funded by the EU, and you are a friend of its head - Jose Angel Gurria.3. You, George Osborne, are the boss of HM Treasury.4. You employed Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England.Does the nation not deserve more independent advice? 

A far-right party has announced it will contest the by-election caused by Jo Cox’s death2016-6-19A FAR-RIGHT party has sparked outrage by announcing it will contest the by-election caused by the death of Jo Cox.Liberty GB says the murder of mother-of-two Mrs Cox is tragic but it cannot allow Labour to retake the constituency of Batley and Spen, West Yorkshire, unchallenged.Instead it is putting up a candidate called Jack Buckby, the party's press officer who used to be a member of the BNP.He announced that he would be standing in a video posted on Facebook video claiming "the Labour Party has blood on its hands".He added: "The constituency is part of a region that has been turned upside-down by mass immigration, with mosques sprouting like triffids, Islamic extremism proliferating, child-rape gangs still on the loose, and long-standing English communities under threat of demographic eradication."This comes after the Conservatives, the Lib Dems and Ukip all said they wouldn’t contest the safe Labour seat in tribute to Jo.A Tory spokesman said giving Labour a free run at holding the seat would be “a mark of respect to a much-loved and respected politician”.But instead of respecting the campaigner who was gunned down and stabbed on Thursday afternoon, Liberty GB announced its decision within hours of Mrs Cox’s family visiting the site where she was killed.At the scene in Birstall yesterday afternoon Jo’s younger sister Kim Leadbeater, 40, fought back tears as she gave a poignant, five-minute speech.Standing before  crowds and floral tributes in the village square — near  where the Batley and Spen MP was murdered —  Kim told how her family was broken, but would mend.She said: “There are some things in life you should never have to do.“Last night I had to go and identify my sister’s body.“Yes, this was Jo Cox MP and she was many things to many people in her too-short life but she was my sister, my only sibling, my parents’ first-born child, a wife and a mum.”Kim said she, her partner and parents  were not used to being in  the public eye.  But they felt compelled  to speak  due to the “overwhelming outpouring of grief, sympathy and love” from around the world.She added: “We want to say a most sincere and heartfelt thank you to everyone who has expressed their love and affection for Jo and sent their thoughts and sympathy to us.“It has genuinely made a difference and helped us through some dark times in the last 48 hours.“From a very young age all Jo wanted was for everybody to be happy.“We were brought up to see the positive in everything.“Our parents instilled in us a real glass-half-full mentality and whilst I sometimes tend to add a large measure of Yorkshire cynicism to this, Jo generally did not.“She only saw the good.“When she would get abuse on Facebook or Twitter we would talk and sometimes cry together but she would still focus on the positive.”Referring to her sister’s “strength and solidarity”, Kim added: “We have to continue this  in the days, months and years to come.“It is part of Jo’s legacy.“For now our family is broken but we will mend over time and  never let Jo leave our lives.“She will live on for all the good people in the world, through (her husband) Brendan, through us, and through her truly wonderful children who will always know what an utterly amazing woman their mother was.“She was a human being.“She was perfect.”Political friends of her heartbroken husband, Brendan Cox, hope he will stand as an MP in the seat she held.A date for the by-election has not yet been set.The 37-year-old former Labour special adviser who once worked in No10 has been an activist since his student days.Mr Cox also won huge plaudits for his moving statement honouring his wife and calling for Britain to reject hate just a few hours after her death.And minutes after his sister-in-law’s speech he Cox tweeted: “Very proud of my sister in law Kim who spoke on behalf of us all and did her sister proud #MoreInCommon.”A by-election to pick Jo Cox’s successor for the West Yorks constituency is likely to be held either next month or in September after the summer holidays.People on social media are disgusted at Liberty GB's decision.get a life stand down do you think you will get votersnazis or wannabe nazis it seems. Losers who want publicity mainlyJust seen that 'Liberty GB' are going to contest the by-election resulting from the murder of #JoCoxMP Please RT and stop these vermin!Yesterday morning Tommy Mair appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with the MP's murder, with possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a knife.He is also charged with causing grievous bodily harm to Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, who was also allegedly attacked at the same time by Mair.When asked his name he responded: "death to traitors, freedom for Britain".He was remanded in custody to appear at London's Old Bailey tomorrow.

Boost for Leave after head of German industry says EU would be ‘very, very foolish’ to erect tariffs on the UK after a Brexit2016-6-22GERMANY would be "very, very foolish" to erect tariffs on the UK after a Brexit said the head of the country's industry body in a boost to the Leave campaign’s economic argument.Boris Johnson seized on the remarks by Markus Kerber, and said the country would be "desperate" for free trade with Britain if voters choose to quit Brussels in tomorrow’s referendum.The Tory said any taxes on British exports to Germany would represent a "regression to times we thought we'd left behind in the 1970s".Mr Kerber, the head of the BDI, or federation of German industries, urged his country and the EU to draw up a free-trade regime that could operate after Brexit.He said if the UK left it would be like a relative leaving the family and lead to "serious disruption" in the German-UK economic relationship.Speaking to the BBC's World Service he said: "Imposing trade barriers, imposing protectionist measures between our two countries - or between the two political centres, the European Union on the one hand and the UK on the other - would be a very, very foolish thing in the 21st century."The BDI would urge politicians on both sides to come up with a trade regime that enables us to uphold and maintain the levels of trade we have, although it will become more difficult."Mr Johnson told a BBC debate on Tuesday night that EU countries would be "insane" to erect trade barriers against the UK if it pulled out of the union, using the specific example of Germany.Responding to Mr Kerber's comments on Wednesday, the Tory MP said: "After the incessant doom-mongering of the In campaign, we now hear the truth from the 'voice of German industry' - that they would be desperate for free trade after we Vote Leave."Of course EU countries will continue trading with us on a tariff-free basis - they would be damaging their own commercial interests if they didn't.“That's why EU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal on Friday."As Sir James Dyson said today, this is the last opportunity to regain control of our futures."If we want to take back control and a more secure and more prosperous future, we have to Vote Leave on June 23."

Civil war Tories roll out plot to protect Cameron’s leadership as Bojo and Gove back him regardless of EU result2016-6-23SENIOR Tories last night began a major operation to save David Cameron’s Premiership from the ruins of his party’s EU referendum civil war.The PM will lead the peace drive personally with an address to the nation from No10’s steps early this morning soon after the historic vote’s result is announced.Senior aides said last night his statement will be “unifying and healing”.He will also offer major olive branches in a bid to reunite furious Brexit-backing MPs, as well as the many millions who voted for Leave or Remain and are left bitterly disappointed.But it also emerged last night that a group of loyal Tory MPs who were backing Leave have been amassing dozens of signatures from their Brexit-supporting colleagues to put in a letter calling for Mr Cameron to stay on in Downing Street, no matter what the result is.LIVE UPDATES: For all the latest on the referendum resultsThe pro-EU Premier will face deafening calls to resign if Britain votes to walk away from Brussels for misjudging the will of the nation.Some angry senior Eurosceptics also say the bad blood which his ‘Project Fear’ attacks on Leave arguments have whipped up mean he is unable to command the whole party’s respect ever again.But the letter, dubbed ‘Operation Save Dave’ by some, is a determined bid to head off any leadership challenge.Two thirds of all Brexit-backing Tory MPs have signed it so far -- 84 out of 128.They included some of the Leave campaign’s biggest beasts such as Cabinet ministers Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, John Whittingdale and Priti Patel, plus former London Mayor and leadership rival Boris Johnson.Speaking out to back the PM as the polls closed last night, Commons Leader Mr Grayling told The Sun: “The most important thing for the Conservative Party is reunite, follow wishes of electorate, and get behind David Cameron as we do so, whatever the result”.A Brexit-backing senior minister added: “A leadership challenge and a new contest that goes on for months is the very last thing we need right now, even if the result is Brexit.“We need stability, not least to keep the markets under control.”The MP who organised the letter, former Foreign Office minister Robert Syms, said: “All of us are anxious to pull together.“We want a stable government to continue and for David Cameron to carry the 2015 manifesto.”But No10 fears the letter may also highlight deep divisions that remain in the party.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith who resigned in fury from the Cabinet in March had not signed it by yesterday afternoon.Another of the PM’s bitter critics, sacked former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, has pointedly refused to sign it.A leadership challenge and a new contest that goes on for months is the very last thing we need right now, even if the result is BrexitOne MP also told The Sun they had signed the letter but would vote to oust David Cameron in a no-confidence vote if 50 rebels club together to force one, and expects others to do the same.The MP said: “If there is a no-confidence vote then Cameron is in trouble.“Many of us who signed the letter in public would vote against him in the privacy of the ballot box.”Other MPs told of deeper anger with George Osborne, who is seen to be behind some of the most heavy handed Brexit scare stories.Several are calling for the Chancellor to be moved from the Treasury in the PM’s reshuffle.No10 sources dismissed claims that he had written two different speeches depending on the referendum result.Instead, Mr Cameron is waiting to hear the final result and crucially the margin of victory before he decides exactly what to say at dawn.If we stay in the EU, the PM will pledge to keep pushing for major reform in Brussels including on the free movement rule to curb immigration.No10 aides have also suggested making Leave boss Mr Gove his Deputy Prime Minister in an immediate gesture to Brexit backers.But Mr Cameron is expected to wait until at least after the weekend before making any changes to the government.He may also postpone an expected reshuffle until September — or even as late as 2017 — to use the spectre of sackings and promotions to keep his MPs in line.No10 also plans to roll out a series of major announcements and decisions in other policy areas over the next month in a bid to divert attentions from the EU.A decision on whether to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport is now expected in two weeks time.And the long-awaited Chilcot report into the Iraq war will be published on July 6.A vote on renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent may also be rushed forward in a bid to unite Tory MPs against divided

Brussels bigwig Jean-Claude warns Britain there’s ‘no second chance’ if UK turns backs Brexit2016-6-22EUROPEAN Union boss Jean-Claude Juncker risked infuriating British voters by threatening to isolate us if we vote to leave the EU.The European Commission president was joined by other ­leaders to insist that there would be no second deal on offer to the UK if it chooses Brexit.Every time a member country has voted down a new EU treaty or plan in the past, it has always been offered better terms.But the UK would not be, Mr Juncker declared, saying instead: “Out is out.”In another explosive outburst, the federalist chief Eurocrat also questioned whether it was right to hold referendums at all.Senior Tories slammed the explosive statement on the eve of the poll as “unbelievable conceit”.But Mr Juncker also appeared to close the door on any further reforms to the EU’s free movement rules — pledged by the PM to Sun readers on Tuesday — even if the UK votes to remain In.The commission boss said David Cameron had already “got the maximum” with his renegotiation in February, panned by Conservative MPs as “thin gruel”.Former Luxembourg PM Mr Juncker insisted: “British voters have to know that there will not be any kind of renegotiation.“We have concluded a deal with the Prime Minister, he got the ­maximum he could receive, we gave the maximum we could give.”Continuing his Brussels rant, arrogant Mr Juncker also slammed the mere idea of giving people a say.Admitting he is “basically not a big fan of referendums”, Mr Juncker added: “Voters can be easily misled by sideshows.“You always get the sweats when someone dares to ask the people for its opinion.”He also admitted Brexit would “damage” the EU project, adding: “The British need the EU and the EU needs British pragmatism.”France’s President Hollande backed up the rant yesterday by also insisting there would be no second deal if voters back Brexit.He claimed “the future of the European Union is at stake”.The Socialist leader dubbed today’s landmark referendum “irreversible”, parroting Mr Cameron’s campaign mantra.Issuing a new veiled threat, Mr Hollande also said Brexit would put Britain at “very serious risk” of losing access to the European Union bloc’s single market.While reinforcing Mr Cameron’s message, the stern last-minute warnings could also backfire on the Remain campaign if they encourage voters across the country to rebel against the EU’s elite.Leave campaigners seized on the threats to insist the Prime Minister was wrong to offer British voters false hope of more EU reform.Brexit campaign boss and Justice Secretary Michael Gove said: “If you vote to stay, there is no prospect of getting any reform from the EU ever again.“The Prime Minister tried to get reforms earlier this year but the EU did not listen.”Mr Gove added: “The EU cannot and will not give the British people the change that they want.”Furious Boris Johnson weighed in, saying: “The president of the European Commission has basically just told David Cameron to bog off.“We’ve already been given the maximum we’re going to get? This is unbelievable, the conceit of these people, what gives him the right?“This isn’t a head of state, this isn’t the head of an elected government.”The former London Mayor added: “Who in the holy **** elected Jean Claude Juncker to anything?“He used to run Luxembourg, it’s a lovely place but about the same size as Wolverhampton.”German leader Angela Merkel held back from an eleventh hour threat after a plea from Downing Street to stay out of the fight four weeks ago.Instead Mrs Merkel issued a plea to voters to back Remain, saying: “Of course I want Britain to stay in the EU but the decision is with British citizens.”On Tuesday, Mr Cameron urged Sun readers to back Britain staying in the EU so he could reform it from within.The Prime Minister claimed: “If we stay in, that is not the end of reform.“Britain will be in a very enhanced position.”

Shell-shocked German Chancellor calls for calm as far-right demands break up of EU2016-6-24A shell-shocked Angela Merkel appealed for calm after the Brexit storm as right-wing parties sought to break up the EU even further.The German chancellor expressed 'great regret' at Britain's Out vote but insisted Europe was 'strong enough' to hold firm.Her comments came after prominent figures on the Continent called for their countries to follow the UK's lead and hold their own referendums.Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said the EU had contributed to peace on the continent, but that stability could not be taken for granted in a "world of turmoil".She said: "We have to recognise the decision of the majority of the British people with deep regret today."There is no point beating about the bush: Today is a watershed for Europe, it is a watershed for the European unification process."The idea of European unification was the idea of peace after centuries of horrendous bloodshed."The founding fathers found a way to come together and it was manifested in the Treaty of Rome almost 60 years ago."For the future, we should not take this for granted."French President Francois Hollande described it as a 'grave test' for the bloc which he 'regretted profoundly'.The two leaders and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi are due to hold damage limitation talks in Berlin on Monday.Hours earlier, Dutch anti-immigration leader Geert Wilders was one of the first to call for his country to launch a ‘Nexit’ bid, sparking a domino effect across Europe.He said: "We want be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders, and our own immigration policy."France's far-right National Front party leader Marine Le Pen hailed the result as a 'victory for freedom' and called for the country's own referendum.She told RTL radio: “Like a lot of French people, I’m very happy that the British people held on and made the right choice. What we thought was impossible yesterday has now become possible.”He posted a picture on her Twitter page proudly holding the Union flag.Her deputy, Florian Philippot, added: "The liberty of peoples always wins in the end! Bravo to the United Kingdom. Our turn now."Congratulations! And thank you! #Brexit #IndependenceDay #SwexitWillFollow https://t.co/e0AfymFpT0Their comments were echoed by Le Pen's niece and fellow National Front member, Marion Le Pen, who insisted the French 'should have the right to choose'.Paula Bieber, from the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party, congratulated Britain and declared: 'Swexit will follow'.Elsewhere reaction has proven mixed.France foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described it as an “emergency”.He tweeted: “Sad for the United Kingdom. Europe continues but it must react and regain the confidence of the people. This is an emergency.”FM #Steinmeier: The early morning news from #GreatBritain are truly sobering. It looks like a sad day for #Europe+the #UnitedKingdom. #UK 🇪🇺Former Sweden PM Carl Bildt called the result "beyond comprehension".He also tweeted a picture of Nigel Farage saying “I dare to Dream” and added the message: “I would classify this as a nightmare.”Cecilia Wikström, EU Parliamentary leader for the Swedish Liberal Party, told local media that Europe would be weakened by the UK's exit.She said: "I regret that the UK now has decided to leave the EU."Europe will become much poorer, weaker and less competitive without them and Sweden have lost a close partner in the Union."The withdrawal will be a strong blow, especially against the British economy, but we must not allow the result of the referendum puts a spoke in the wheels of Europe's future."The German Foreign office tweeted saying it was a "sad day for Europe" and called Britain's exit "sobering".Dutch PM Mark Rutte said the out vote "must be stimulus for more reform in Europe". He said the UK's decision seemed "irreversible" but warned it could take a long time.An Irish government spokesman said the result has "very significant implications" for Ireland.Its PM Enda Kenny is due to make statement later this morning.Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, looked and sounded forlorn at a press conference this morning.He said he had contacted leaders of the remaining member states to arrange a meeting to discuss the future.He said: “It’s true the last year has been the most difficult one in the history of our union.“But I will always remember what my father used to tell me: ‘what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.”The shockwaves of the Out vote are being felt on the other side of the globe.Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he is "confident" that his country can weather the UK’s departure from the EU and says he will push on with trade negotiations.He said: "I have no doubt that in due course the British Government will negotiate a satisfactory departure from the European Union," the Prime Minister said."This could take several years, and in the meantime, I have no doubt that our relations with the United Kingdom, which are as close as any two nations' relations could be, will continue as positively and intimately as ever."Equally, with Europe, we have been negotiating a European free trade agreement, and built strong ties with the countries of continental Europe, in particular France and Germany, and I'm confident that our negotiations towards a free trade agreement with the European Union will continue."So there is no cause for Australians to be alarmed by these developments."We pay for your stories!

Prime Minister’s former ‘guru’ Steve Hilton says David Cameron knew his election pledge to cut immigration was impossible YEARS ago2016-6-21DAVID Cameron knew his target to cut immigration to "tens of thousands" was impossible for four years but continued to make the pledge, one of his closest former aides claimed last night.Steve Hilton - who attended top-level meetings with the Prime Minister - said civil servants directly warned the PM he was on mission impossible because EU rules insist on the free movement of people.But despite being told in 2012 it was a no-go, he said Mr Cameron repeated the promise - even including it in his general election manifesto last year.In an interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Hilton said: "We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it."Just weeks ago the PM insisted he stuck by his ''ambition'' of bringing net migration into the UK - which last month hit 333,000.Mr Hilton added: "You don't need to sit in a 'stock take' meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we're in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it."In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable."When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave."For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what (Michael) Gove and (Boris) Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics."The policy guru, who is godfather to one of the PM’s kids, also attacks leading Remain campaigner George Osborne.He says the Chancellor and the “political elite” are “playing with fire” by demonising the public’s desire for control over our borders and destiny.Mr Hilton writes: “Our broken immigration system is a social disaster because the decency and tolerance of the British people, virtues that our politicians so love to talk about when it suits them, are mocked when they see their local communities and public services overwhelmed by sudden and unplanned-for arrivals of people in large numbers — the kind of dramatic changes which, needless to say, don’t affect the neighbourhoods inhabited by our insular ruling elite.”He adds: “There’s a broader argument here, too, because the EU debate isn’t just about immigration, which is why it is so offensive for the Remain campaign to argue, as George Osborne put it, that those like me who want to leave the EU ‘want a meaner, narrower Britain’.“The fact is that with areas such as the economy, the environment, our legal system — which affect people’s everyday lives in Britain — membership of the EU makes it impossible for the elected government to govern our country in the true sense of the word.“It seems to me that here in Britain, and especially in this referendum campaign, our insular ruling elite is playing with fire.”Mr Hilton, who describes himself as an immigrant, finishes by saying: “By dismissing - or worse, demonising - people’s desire for control over the things that matter to them, and their perfectly reasonable expectation that the government they elect should have the power to deliver its promises, the rulers are the ones stoking the anger they decry.“Undeliverable promises. An ungovernable country. An untrusted political establishment. This is what the EU has helped do to our country.“We can’t go on like this. It’s time for change. It’s time to leave.”Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team? Email us at tips@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4368

David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn call for tolerance and announce Parliament to be re-called in extraordinary joint statement on murder of MP Jo Cox2016-6-17DAVID Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn called for tolerance and announced Parliament will be recalled after the horrific murder of MP Jo Cox.The PM and the Labour leader said 'our nation is in shock' as they made an unprecedented joint statement to call for unity, close to the spot where the mum of two was slaughtered yesterday.Joined by Commons Speaker John Bercow, the pair leader paid their respects to the fallen MP and laid flowers in Birstall, West Yorkshire this afternoon.Mr Corbyn said he had asked the Prime Minister to recall MPs to Parliament on Monday to pay tribute to their 41-year-old colleague, and that this had been agreed.The House of Commons is currently not sitting due to the EU referendum on June 23.Speaking about Jo Cox's death Mr Cameron said: "Two children have lost their mother and a husband has lost his loving wife."Parliament has lost one of its most passionate campaigners and the nation is shocked."Today our nation is rightly shocked. And I think it is a moment to stand back and think about some of the things that are so important about our country.In tribute to Jo Cox, we must drive out hatred, division and intolerance where we find them in our public life and communities."The fact that we should treasure and value our democracy, where members of parliament are out in the public, accountable to the public and available to the public and that's how Jo died."She died doing her job."The PM went on to say: "Where we see hatred, where we find division, where we see intolerance we must drive it out of our politics and out of our public life and out of our communities.Jeremy Corbyn and I stood together to pay tribute to Jo Cox - an extraordinary and compassionate campaigning MP. pic.twitter.com/7SgxLOiRIK"If we truly want to honour Jo, then what we should do is recognise that her values - service, community, tolerance - the values she lived by and worked by, those are the values that we need to redouble in our national life in the months and years to come."Mother-of-two Mrs Cox was shot and stabbed in broad daylight yesterday near a library where she held regular constituency surgeries.A 52-year-old man, named locally as Tommy Mair, was arrested in connection and remain in police custody.The two party leaders paid tribute to the universally admired MP at a memorial set up in the Yorkshire town where mourners have been paying their respects.Mr Corbyn said of his Labour colleague: "She was taken from us in an act of hatred, in a vile act that has killed her. It's an attack on democracy, what happened yesterday."Jo was an exceptional, wonderful, very talented woman, taken from us in her early 40s when she had so much to give and so much of her life ahead of her."It's a tragedy beyond tragedy what has happened yesterday."He went on to say: "In her memory, we will not allow those people that spread hatred and poison to divide our society, we will strengthen our democracy, strengthen our free speech."She was a truly wonderful woman. I'm deeply sorry, deeply sad, for what has happened to her."My condolences to all the people of Batley and Spen who she represented so well, and of course to a wonderful family - her husband, her children and all of her wider family."In tearful scenes earlier today, fellow Labour MPs visited the spot to lay flowers for their fallen colleague.Heartbroken former shadow secretary Rachel Reeves broke down in tears as she told how the community had been left "numb and angry" by Mrs Cox's murder.“This is such a normal place,” she said."The sort of street that is recognisable in any part.“To think that such a horrific and violent crime took place against such a wonderful woman… there is a sense of numbness, not being able to believe what has happened.“And anger that someone could take away someone who had so much to give.“There is also grief and sorrow at the death of a mother, wife, daughter and a friend to many of us.”Here is David Cameron's full statement on Jo Cox's murder:“I first met Jo in Darfur in 2006 where she was doing what she was brilliant at, which was looking after and saving the lives of vulnerable refugees.“And here we are today commemorating her life that’s been lost.“And of course the most profound thing that has happened is that two children have lost their mother, a husband has lost a loving wife, and parliament has lost one of its most passionate and brilliant campaigners, someone who epitomised the fact that politics is about serving others.“Today our nation is rightly shocked. And I think it is a moment to stand back and think about some of the things that are so important about our country.“The fact that we should treasure and value our democracy, where members of parliament are out in the public, accountable to the public, available to the public, and that’s how Jo died.“She died doing her job.“I think the second thing is that we should recognise that politics is about public service.“People who go into public life, they want to act in the public interest, to pursue the national interest, to do things for other people, to make the country, make the world a better place.“Politicians disagree with each other. We often disregard what politicians say, disregard each other and the rest of it.“But at the end of the day that is what it is about, and that is what Jo showed it is all about.“But, perhaps, most important of all we should value and see as precious the democracy that we have on these islands were 65 million of us live together and work together and get on together.“We do have peace, we do have stability and we do have a measure of economic wellbeing better than other countries, obviously still to be spread far more widely.“And it is all underpinned by tolerance.“So where we see hatred, where we find division, where we see intolerance we must drive it out of our politics and out of our public life and out of our communities.“And if we truly want to honour Jo, then what we should do is recognise that her values - service, community, tolerance - the values she lived by and worked by, those are the values that we need to redouble in our national life in the months and years to come.”Shadow cabinet member Lucy Powell also paid a tearful tribute to Mrs Cox at the scene.As a mark of respect for Jo Cox MP our flag is flying at half-mast over Number 10 today pic.twitter.com/vpiOEBXOKHOther MPs chose to defiantly go ahead with their constituency surgeries in the wake of Mrs Cox's murder.The Union Jack flag flew at half mast today over the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and City Hall.With just days to go until the EU referendum, both Leave and Remain campaigns suspended hostilities in a symbol of unity.Downing Street also confirmed the Conservative party would not be contesting Mrs Cox's seat as a mark of respect.Ukip and the Lib Dems confirmed they too would not be fielding a candidate in the upcoming by-election.Here is Jeremy Corbyn's full statement on Jo Cox's murder:“We need our whole society to be secure. Jo was brutally murdered here 24 hours ago in this town - a town she loved, a town she grew up in, serving a community she loved."And in her life she'd worked for anti-slavery campaigns, she'd worked for Oxfam, she was a campaigner for human rights and justice all around the world."She was taken from us in an act of hatred, in a vile act that has killed her. It's an attack on democracy, what happened yesterday."Jo was an exceptional, wonderful, very talented woman, taken from us in her early 40s when she had so much to give and so much of her life ahead of her."It's a tragedy beyond tragedy what has happened yesterday."In her memory, we will not allow those people that spread hatred and poison to divide our society, we will strengthen our democracy, strengthen our free speech."She was a truly wonderful woman. I'm deeply sorry, deeply sad, for what has happened to her.“My condolences to all the people of Batley and Spen who she represented so well, and of course to a wonderful family - her husband, her children and all of her wider family.“I've asked the Prime Minister and Speaker for the recall of Parliament on Monday and they've accepted that request.“And Parliament will be recalled on Monday so that we can pay due tribute to her on behalf of everybody in this country who values democracy, values the right of free speech and values the right of political expression, free from the kind of brutality that Jo suffered."That's why we all need to come together to understand that everyone must have protection and security in order to function in a democratic society."

Jeremy Corbyn congratulates Germany on decision to invite over a MILLION refugees to Europe2016-6-21JEREMY CORBYN last night praised Angela Merkel for throwing open Europe’s borders to over a million refugees – and insisted Britain should take more of them.And the Labour leader – supposedly trying to win voters over to staying in the EU – declared he was “no lover” of the European Union and Leave may win.In an eve-of-Referendum TV debate, the Labour leader said the German Chancellor’s decision to waive border controls last summer to encourage Syrians to head to Germany last was a “humanitarian response”.And he insisted he would be making a “very strong plea” in the coming weeks for Britain and other EU member states next month to “house more refugees”.So far David Cameron has only agreed to take 26,000 between now and 2020.Angela Merkel’s decision in September last year is widely seen as having fuelled the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War.But Mr Corbyn said: “I think Angela Merkel was trying to make a humanitarian response. On refugees, we have to deal with the problem at source.”The Labour leader’s comments came in his final TV appearance of the Referendum campaign – one in which he has been slammed for his lacklustre support for the EU.Speaking last night he said there was no way he would be to blame if the pro-EU Remain campaign lost.But while insisting he would be voting Remain on Thursday, he blasted the EU for trying to sign a “damaging” trade deal with the US, the way it “shields tax havens”, and its “questionably legal” refugee agreement with Turkey.David Cameron insists a free trade deal with the US -- dubbed ‘TTIP’ -- is a central reason for remaining inside the EU.But Mr Corbyn said he was bitterly opposed as it would “the worst of working conditions and standards from the US in to the EU”.He told the audience: “There’s every chance it will never see the light of day and that’s why we have to press very hard to oppose it.”He added that if he ever became Prime Minister, he would take on Brussels by renationalising the railways despite EU legislation calling for more privatisation.Mr Corbyn explained that he was backing Remain after a life of fierce Eurosceptism as he wanted to try and reform the organisation from inside.Voters have gone to UKIP and to the SNP because they don’t see Labour as representing them anymoreLast night Jeremy Corbyn was criticised by one his closest allies for not doing enough to win back lost working class voters.Jon Lansman -- who ran the hard-left socialist’s leadership campaign -- admitted that Labour “alienated our core voters, millions of them."They’ve gone to Ukip and to the SNP because they don’t see Labour as representing them anymore.”Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: “What Jeremy’s got to do now is he's got to come up with a positive programme, not opposition to what the Tories are doing.”The boss of the hard-left Momentum group claimed the Shadow Chancellor was doing a better job than the hapless Labour leader.“It’s actually John McDonnell who is leading on that stuff, and yes I think there’s a lot already that’s come out, but there’s a lot more work to do,” he said.Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

My heart says Brexit but my head is telling me it’s a step that will end in economic catastrophe2016-6-18SO the week has finally come when we vote in the referendum to decide whether Britain should remain in – or leave – the European Union.I don’t need to tell you it’s not a simple decision to make.And I’m sure you, like most ­people, have a battle going on between your head and your heart.Certainly, I’m feeling a struggle.My heart is saying, “I love my country, I want to protect it.“We don’t want anyone telling us what to do and we’d be OK on our own.”My mind, though, is telling me to overrule my heart.Sure, being part of the EU is far from perfect.I’m under no illusion.But there simply isn’t a convincing enough argument to leave it either.To take the plunge and leave is a step so riddled with uncertainty that only chaos, confusion and economic catastrophe can result.I know some people are talking about the “short-term pain” of disentangling ourselves from the EU, but that “short-term” pain could take five years.Believe me, a lot of disruption and mayhem can happen in five years.One of the biggest concerns, understandably, is immigration.But some people seem to think if they vote Leave, we’ll return to the Britain of the Fifties with milk floats doing the rounds in the morning and all of us knowing our neighbours, that we will somehow “close the door”.But in our hearts I think we all know that the Britain of old will never come back.People’s biggest beef about immigration, rightly, is the whole “something for nothing” culture.Reading stories about immigrants who get six-bedroom houses, cars and goodness knows what else, it’s no wonder we feel annoyed.I’m pretty sure that is what people who vote Leave are voting against.But voting Leave will not address that issue.We want people to want to come here but to have basic principles.We want them to speak English and integrate with our community and we want them to get a job, pay taxes and put something back.That’s why the system is changing.David Cameron’s negotiation that immigrants can’t get benefits for four years, and that European immigrants without a job should be sent home after six months, is a better solution than leaving the EU — and losing our access to the prestigious single ­market, which will crash the economy.It’s important not to underestimate the security we gain from being able to trade freely in Europe.It’s also the spark and opportunity that many entrepreneurs need to get going.By being part of Europe, every entrepreneur has free access to a market of 500million people, which gives new businesses vital security.If we leave and are on the outside of that but still want to benefit from free trade, we will have to make serious concessions to be able to do that, such as the freedom of movement.We will end up back where we started but without having a seat at the table to make decisions.Small British businesses overwhelmingly want to stay in Europe as they don’t have the huge resources and budgets that big businesses can fall back on to deal with lots of ­different rules and regulations.As part of the single market they can trade in Europe without needing that.That’s why more than three-quarters of small businesses want us to stay in Europe.If we leave they won’t flourish and thrive in the way they are able to now.Don’t forget that 99 per cent of businesses in Britain are small.They are the lifeblood of our economy.We won’t get another vote in a few years If we left Europe we’d be cutting these small businesses off from that single market.That would be a blow to entrepreneurs.Instead of having free access to a market of more than 500million, it would be cut down to 65million.All of a sudden that plan to invest or take on new employees would look that much riskier.For many businesses, the uncertainty would mean it would not happen and that opportunity would be missed.Also, it’s entrepreneurs who create jobs, not the Government.So what’s bad news for them is bad news for people across the country.We all remember the impact the last recession had on young people.They could leave school having worked hard in their exams and still struggle to find work.With nine out of ten economists warning our economy would take another hit if we leave, why would we risk seeing that all over again?Make no mistake, it is our kids and grandkids who will pay the price for bad decisions we make.Everyone wants to make sure their children can get on in life if they work hard.The only way to secure that is to keep our economy strong and back business by staying in the single market and remaining in Europe.This vote is irreversible.Unlike a General Election, we won’t get another vote in a few years.If we leave, there’s no going back.In my opinion, it’s simply not worth the risk. I LAUGHED at seeing the photos of the size 14 woman showing how impossible it was to squeeze into a pair of “unrealistically small” size 16 trousers in H&M, above.Let’s face it, we’ve all been there.Let’s just say that no normal woman over 30 should ever try to shop at the likes of H&M unless they are prepared to buy size 18.And words don’t do justice to the gloom that goes with that experience.Conversely, though, what about that thrilling feeling you get when you find yourself fitting effortlessly into a size, or even two sizes, smaller than the one you normally wear?In my experience, this moment usually happens in Marks & Spencer or Hobbs.Like most women, I’ve been shopping for summer clothes lately.Either there’s that horrible moment when you put something on and think, “Oh my God, I’m HUGE”, or you slip effortlessly into a size down – and feel so good about yourself you go and have a cream cake.Isn’t it silly.Even though the interpretation of size by different brands varies wildly, there is an indisputable psychological punch that goes with having to go up a size that most women struggle with.But we all know sizing is often nothing but a branding exercise.(My mum will never forget going into Karen Millen and asking for a size 16 and being met with a silence frostier than Mr Whippy.)The truth is, of course, it doesn’t matter what size you are and unless there are strict measurement guidelines implemented by law, companies will feel free to “interpret” them at will.Let’s face it, the UK is full of far more Rebel Wilsons than there are Kate Mosses.So don’t let yourself get caught up by what is really just a number in a label.There is no point trying to squeeze into a size because you can’t bear to try a size bigger.The good news is the size is not written on the outside, so no one needs to know. IT’S always such a relief when celebrities lose weight but refuse to give up wine.Like Oprah Winfrey, above, who looks amazing after losing 30lb.But I’m sorry to say – and believe me, I only know this from bitter experience – it’s one thing to lose it and quite another to keep it off.And the fact that Oprah, the original yo-yo dieter, can’t give up wine or bread is probably the thing that makes it harder than ever to keep the weight off.Still, you know my motto: A little bit of what you fancy . . .And don’t forget the one thing everyone on a diet has in common – they are miserable.AREN’T we lucky to have all these fabulous ­sixtysomething role models, the latest being Christie Brinkley?She is phenomenal and I don’t know how she does it.It just goes to show that it’s all in the genes because no matter how much surgery you have, you’d never look like that.Sure, she obviously looks after herself.And yes, she is the poster girl for growing old gracefully – for not trying too hard or aiming to be something she is not.But what really strikes me about this photo is how happy she looks.You really can’t put that in a bottle or syringe.Mind you, I’d be happy if I looked like her.

Questions over how border between Northern Ireland and Republic will be controlled2016-6-24Britain’s Out vote could see the introduction of border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland.With uncertainty over what happens next there are fresh concerns about the relationship between the North and South.Some have suggested a “hard border” to control movement of people and goods between the territories.This could involve a passport checkpoint or electronic checks.Prior to the vote both the UK and Northern Ireland were part of the EU, and there was unrestricted free movement across the border.An important part of the Irish peace settlement was a deal to make the border less important.It is feared the referendum result will put the fragile 1994 ceasefires at risk.But following Brexit, Sinn Fein has made calls for a border poll.Declan Kearney, of the Northern Ireland Assembly, told the BBC: "This outcome tonight dramatically changes the political landscape here in the north of Ireland and we will be intensifying our case for the calling of a border poll.”Enda Kenny, leader of Fine Gael and Taoiseach, warned throughout the campaign that we could see a return of border controls.Today the Irish government has said the UK vote to leave the European Union will have "very significant implications for Ireland".Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU Referendum by a majority of 56% to 44%.But the UK voted by a narrow margin to leave.Only London and Scotland backed up its Remain stance.We pay for your stories!

Brexit: Is the Premier League about to welcome players from the far corners of the world at the expense of Euro talent?2016-6-24VOTERS opted to leave the European Union in a monumental decision on Friday morning.As politicians, political commentators and the public were left wondering how the decision would affect them, football fans were wondering how it would affect the sport and the Premier League.The short answer, as with most of the consequences of the decision, is that nobody truly knows - especially with membership in the EU to last for anything between two and 10 more years.But one happy consequence could be an increase in the amount of South American talent we see in England.With freedom of movement and freedom of labour laws now set to change after the referendum, European players may not be able to move to the Premier League so easily.But that could open up opportunities for players from South America, Africa and Asia, who were previously subject to heavy restrictions on visas and work permits.Brian Monteith of the Leave.eu campaign told the BBC: "The freedom of movement for people in the EU comes at the price of heavy restrictions on visas for potential signings from Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia."Once we leave the EU, the UK will be free to treat footballers from all countries equally, which will broaden the pool of talent for our teams, not reduce it."European-born players will no longer have that work permit advantage over their non-European rivals, meaning Premier League clubs could be more inclined to look at talent further afield.Work permit rules will likely be relaxed, experts predict - they are not laws but rather regulations agreed by the Football Association and the Home Office.The current rules would have meant that some of last season's top stars, such as Dimitri Payet, N'Golo Kante and Anthony Martial, would not have been allowed to come to the Premier League.But the rules are not black and white, with an appeals process to allow certain players (Willian in the past) in if they are exceptional talents who do not reach the criteria.Another major boost for South American players, and perhaps young British players in academies, will be that Article 19 of FIFA's transfer regulations will also have to be changed.That rule states that no players under the age of 18 are allowed to be transferred.But European clubs have been able to get around that quite easily, with players from the EU and EAA allowed to move from 16.The loophole allowed Arsenal to poach Cesc Fabregas and Hector Bellerin from Barcelona when they were that age.It could mean good news for teams around Europe who no longer have to worry about big clubs hoovering up teenage talent before they ever make the first-team.With those players no longer at Premier League clubs from such an early age, managers and scouts will surely have to look further for talent.However, Premier League chief Richard Scudamore warned that Brexit could be bad news for the division.Scudamore, along with all 20 clubs, threw their weight behind the remain campaign.Broadcasting deals were negotiated for £5.14billion last year and Scudamore believes that the deals, which are for separate amounts for different nations, are reliant on a strong Premier League.Earlier this year he said: "I believe we, in the UK, must be in Europe from a business perspective."I believe in the free movement of goods, but when it comes to services, we must be entitled, especially in the audio-visual world, to territorialism."Costs could also increase for travelling supporters.With air fares and train tickets predicted to increase, and British tourists likely needing visas, following your club on the continent will likely be more expensive than ever.

Jo Cox’s husband pays emotional tribute as thousands join him and his kids on what would have been murdered MP’s 42nd birthday2016-6-22MURDERED Jo Cox’s widower Brendan led emotional tributes to her as events took place around the world to celebrate her life on what would have been her 42nd birthday.Speaking in front of thousands of people in Trafalgar Square Mr Cox told the crowd he had come to say how much the love and support of well-wishers meant to him.And he said he wanted his two children Cuillin and Lejla how well loved their mother was.He said: “She just wanted people to be happy and for the world to be a fairer place, that’s where her politics came from.“When she saw pain she wanted to do all she could to alleviate it.“Jo lived her life to the full, with a pedal to the floor with missing brake pads.“She was a mountain climber, a runner, a cyclist, an avid reader, an awful cook, a swimmer, a great exaggerator, a wild food forager, a middle lane driver, a ball of energy and determination, and above all else she was a mum.“She was the best mum that any child could wish for and wish we do, to have her back in our lives.“Since Thursday Cuillin, Lejla and I have spoken every day about the things we will miss, the memories we will cherish.“We try to remember not how cruelly she has been taken from us but how unbelievably lucky we were to have her in our lives for so long.”Organisers said the events, being held in a variety of locations, are a tribute to Mrs Cox's "love, energy, passion, flair, Yorkshire heritage and belief in the humanity of every person in every place".The band that played at the couple's wedding, Diddley Dee, performed and a group of the MP's friends formed an honour guard dressed in suffragette-style sashes.Leaders of multiple faiths laid some 42 white roses, the symbol of Yorkshire, to mark her birthday at the event, hosted by Mrs Cox's friend, Mariella Frostrup.Giving speeches in memory of the murdered MP were the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and actors Gillian Anderson and Bill Nighy.Her life was also commemorated at the Glastonbury Festival this afternoon.Revellers stopped and held an impromptu two minute silence to pay their respects to the murdered Labour politician. To get to the event in Trafalgar Square Mr Cox and his children led a flotilla of houseboats from the community where they live.And to commemorate the Yorkshire MP, a boat called the Yorkshire Rose was filled with flowers in memory of her and towed along as part of the flotilla.  The family of Jo Cox made an emotional journey along the Thames, towing a boat full of flowers in her memoryHolding his dad's hand Cuillin Cox makes his way to the service to celebrate his mother, the murdered MP Jo Cox who would have been 42 todayA fund created in Cox's memory by her friends and family has raised more than £1.25million for charities close to her heart, following more than 37,500 individual donations.Mrs Cox was shot and stabbed in the street last Thursday in her Batley and Spen constituency in West Yorkshire, where there will also be a commemoration with her sister Kim Leadbeater.The murder of Mrs Cox, who was campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union and was a major advocate for refugee rights, shook the EU referendum campaign and sent shock waves around the world.The commemorations began less than 18 hours before the polls open in Britain's closely-contested referendum on whether it should stay in the EU or leave.Widower Brendan Cox, in his first interview since his wife's murder, said he thought she was murdered due to her political beliefs."She was a politician and she had very strong political views and I believe she was killed because of those views," he told BBC television."I think she died because of them, and she would want to stand up for those in death as much as she did in life."He also said she had "worried" about the tone of the EU referendum debate -- "the tone of whipping up fears and whipping up hatred potentially".Hers was the first murder of a British politician since 1990 when Ian Gow was assassinated by Irish Republican Army paramilitaries.Thomas Mair, 52, has been charged with Cox's murder.On his first appearance in court on Saturday, he gave his name as "Death to traitors, freedom for Britain".A psychiatric report was requested.

Tony Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown back David Cameron’s frantic final call for Brits to stay in EU2016-6-22ALL three living ex-Prime Ministers joined David Cameron last night to issue one final plea to Brits to stay in the EU.The current PM was backed by Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in his call on the nation not to risk economic turmoil by walking away from Brussels.Mr Cameron ended a frantic and sleepless 24 hour bus tour of Britain with a final campaign rally in Birmingham last night.His job is on the line if Brexit wins today’s poll, with MPs privately insisting he would have to resign.Despite the pressure, the PM still insisted yesterday he would stay on in Downing Street to deliver the “instructions of the British people” whatever today’s result is.Delivering his emotive final appeal in rolled up shirt sleeves, the Premier said he was boiling down his entire pitch to “one last word – together”.Mr Cameron told a crowd of In supporters: “There isn’t one problem in the world that we can’t solve better by working together.“That is what this vote is all about.“I’m wildly patriotic about what this country can do in the future.“The Britain I know doesn’t quit, it doesn’t walk away, it stands and fights.”His Labour predecessor in No10 Mr Brown joined him on the rally podium to add: “We will be no less British as a result of cooperating with our neigbours.“I want us to take control again so unity replaces division.”Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron was joined on his tour by Sir John Major to bolster his plea to older voters to switch to Remain for their offspring’s sake.The former Tory PM joked: “I represent the grey vote. Some say I always have done.”Sir John added: ““I owe it to my children and grandchildren to look forward, because I want their freedoms to be secure”.Mr Cameron let his nerves show at times yesterday and had a testy exchange with Radio 4’s John Humphrys.The PM snapped at him during a live Today Programme interview: “”You will interrupt yourself in a minute John if you don’t watch it”.He was also forced to deny that Britain is “shackled to a corpse” by staying in the EU, insisting: “You can see European economies recovering”.Labour’s former deputy leader Harriet Harman spent all of yesterday on the PM’s battle bus with him in a show of cross-party unit.But new Labour boss and Remain-backer Jeremy Corbyn refused to meet up with Mr Cameron despite hiw own party activists’ pleas.While keeping away from the campaign trail yesterday, Tony Blair joined the other PMs to issue statements together, saying: “Britain faces a historic choice between prosperity, influence and security as part of Europe, or a reckless leap in the dark and years of damaging uncertainty.“If we vote to leave, there is no going back.“Voting Remain will secure Britain’s place as a proud, influential country with a strong economy and a bright future.”

Boris Johnson tells The Sun’s cabbie Brits should send a massive signal to Europe by voting Leave2016-6-19BORIS Johnson has called on Brits to vote for Brexit to punish the EU for "cheating us” with a shoddy new deal.In an interview with The Sun’s Cabbie, the former London Mayor said other European leaders refused to listen to the nation’s desperate appeal for tougher immigration controls.Instead, the senior Tory insisted: “They tried to fob us off and it has not worked”.Calling for Brits to vote to leave on Thursday, Mr Johnson also said Brexit would help the rest of the EU, adding: “It would be a massive, massive signal to the rest of Europe that now is the time for change”.Boris also lashed out at Remain campaigners’ accusations that Brexit backers are racist as “incredibly offensive” during the interview in the back of the Sun Cab.Brexiteers are actually on the “anti-racist side of the argument” because EU immigration rules are “incredibly discriminatory against people who don’t come from Europe”, he explained.He also told real-life London taxi driver Grant Davis - who is still undecided how to vote - that Remain campaign bosses “are really trying to scare people” with doomsday scenarios of economic disasters under Brexit because they now fear defeat.BoJo explained: “They are and less confident about the outcome.“They are panicked about people suddenly looking up, lifting their eyes to the horizon and feeling a sense of confidence and excitement about what Britain can do”.It was “absolute rubbish” that his stand against David Cameron was just so he could take over as Tory leader, Boris also claimed.But he ducked Grant’s demands for guarantees that Brexit wouldn’t lead to job losses, and that Britain would be able to slash immigration to below 100,000 a year. THE CAB INTERVIEW:G: It is all getting a bit personal isn’t it? Last week, I was watching the telly and Amber Rudd, she said you are the life and soul of the party but she would not like you to be driving her home.What did she mean by that? What does she know about you Boris? You are not a pervert are you?B:  No, no. The crucial thing is that we are in a situation that we can’t control and at the moment.It is though I have got into an unlicensed mini-cab, and the guy does not know which way to go, he does not speak very good English, and we are going into a destination I can’t control.That is exactly what is happening now with the EU Grant.G: If we come out, do you think that the rest of Europe - the people of Portugal, Spain - would demand a referendum like England?B: I think it would be a massive, massive signal to the rest of Europe that now is the time for change. They tried to get away with cheating us. They tried to get away with zero change in negotiation. They tried to fob us off and it has not worked.  It will strike a blow for freedom and democracy if you vote on Thursday.G: John Major has called you a court jester. Is that deserved?B: People will try to reduce this debate to personalities, when what we need to do is focus on the issues, and the facts.G:  How do you feel about them trying to give you a bit of kicking?B: As we say in Brussels, donnez moi a break.G: Sounds like something out of Only Fools and Horses.  What does that mean?B: Gimme a break – it doesn’t matter at all what people say, provided we get the facts over and give people the choice.  This is not about politicians, this is about the people of this country finally having a choice to express their views.  They are coming centre stage now.G: Lots of cabbies have said a lot worse.B:  They certainly have, that is for sure.G: Why do you think David Cameron said we could survive outside the EU and now he says we can’t?B: Because I think they are panicked.  I think the Remain side is what we call jibbing.  They are panicked about people suddenly looking up, lifting their eyes to the horizon and feeling a sense of confidence and excitement about what Britain can do.G: Listen, I want to talk to you about immigration Boris.  We know with David Cameron he has been saying that a few years ago he is going to get immigration down to under 100,000, and he can’t do it.If we leave the EU, what guarantees can you give me and the readers of The Sun that you can get the immigration down?B: What we can guarantee is that we can bring in a points based system, an Australian style points based system so that politicians are actually able to deliver on their promises.At the moment people can stand up and say they are going to cut immigration to the tens of thousands when they do not have the legal ability to do that, and that is ridiculous.G: What do you think about people saying that if you are an outer you are a bit of a closet racist, you are a little Jonny Englander?  Do you think they have got a point?B: I think it is incredibly offensive.G: Is there a bit of xenophobia creeping in the out campaign?B: Absolutely not, because what we are calling for a balanced policy.  At the moment you could argue that the EU policy is incredibly discriminatory against people who don’t come from Europe and I think that is unfair. I think actually we are the anti-racist side of the argument.G: People in the cab have said to me, you know what this is about?  And I go, no, go on tell me.  And they say, it is all about Boris wanting to be in Number 10. Being the new Prime Minister.B: No.G: What do you say to that?B: Absolute rubbish. It suits people to try to turn it into a conversation about personalities.G: You think Remain are losing the argument Boris?B: I do. I think though that what we have seen in the last few days in particular is more and more panic by the In camp and I think they are less and less confident about the outcome, so they are really trying to scare people which is totally wrong.  You should not be running this country down, we can’t cope. We are a great country, we should believe in ourselves.G: It has come to my attention Boris that you dye your hair. Is it true?B: It is not. Unfortunately I thought the journalist in question was being ironic, so I gave what I thought was an ironic answer back.G: I thought you said you reached for the platinum blond bottle.B: No I don’t. I wouldn’t.  I never have done.GRANT'S VERDICT ON BORIS:“Boris is saying if we leave, it will be the promised land on everything. But is that really going to happen? I like him and I want to believe him, but I just don't know. What will we be left with if it all doesn't come true?”

The Donald accuses U.S. President of pushing the UK out of Europe by lecturing them to stay in2016-6-24Donald Trump has sensationally accused Barack Obama of forcing Britain out of the EU by preaching that they should stay in.The presidential hopeful said the outgoing leader's endorsement failed because 'a lot of people don't like him'.The U.S. President angered many voters when he flew to London in April to make his case in person.Standing alongside David Cameron, he said UK business would take a hit and stressed that America would be in no hurry to renegotiate a free trade deal with Britain.Speaking at the opening of his new Turnberry hotel and golf course, Mr Trump said: "I was surprised that President Obama would be so bold to come here and tell people what to do."I think a lot of people don't like him and I think if he had not said it I think you're result might have been different."He added: "He got involved, I don't know if that was through a friendship with David Cameron. It could have been."I understand friendship and I can understand why he did it, but I think it is something that he shouldn't have done. It's not his country, it's not his part of the world."He shouldn't have done it and I actually think his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail."This afternoon, the president took a softer tone about the future of the UK, insisting that the "special relationship" between the two countries was "enduring".He said: "The United Kingdom's membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of U.S. foreign, security, and economic policy."So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond."The immediate aftermath of the referendum result saw turmoil on the markets, with the FTSE plunging by more than 7 per cent at one stage and later saw Mr Cameron resign.The billionaire tycoon - who supported a Brexit - said Mr Cameron "probably did the right thing" in resigning after he backed a vote to Remain in the EU with the endorsement of Mr Obama.He said he liked Mr Cameron, but added that the British Prime Minister 'wrong' on the EU referendum by not getting "the mood of his country right".He said Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who led the charge for the UK to Leave the EU, will be a good replacement as "he got it right so that gives him an advantage".Mr Trump chose the day after the referendum to open his new golf course on the west coast of Scotland and pledged to "fix" the US in the same way he refurbished the "dilapidated" Turnberry hotel.

Jeremy Corbyn congratulates Germany on decision to invite over a MILLION refugees to Europe2016-6-21JEREMY CORBYN last night praised Angela Merkel for throwing open Europe’s borders to over a million refugees – and insisted Britain should take more of them.And the Labour leader – supposedly trying to win voters over to staying in the EU – declared he was “no lover” of the European Union and Leave may win.In an eve-of-Referendum TV debate, the Labour leader said the German Chancellor’s decision to waive border controls last summer to encourage Syrians to head to Germany last was a “humanitarian response”.And he insisted he would be making a “very strong plea” in the coming weeks for Britain and other EU member states next month to “house more refugees”.So far David Cameron has only agreed to take 26,000 between now and 2020.Angela Merkel’s decision in September last year is widely seen as having fuelled the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War.But Mr Corbyn said: “I think Angela Merkel was trying to make a humanitarian response. On refugees, we have to deal with the problem at source.”The Labour leader’s comments came in his final TV appearance of the Referendum campaign – one in which he has been slammed for his lacklustre support for the EU.Speaking last night he said there was no way he would be to blame if the pro-EU Remain campaign lost.But while insisting he would be voting Remain on Thursday, he blasted the EU for trying to sign a “damaging” trade deal with the US, the way it “shields tax havens”, and its “questionably legal” refugee agreement with Turkey.David Cameron insists a free trade deal with the US -- dubbed ‘TTIP’ -- is a central reason for remaining inside the EU.But Mr Corbyn said he was bitterly opposed as it would “the worst of working conditions and standards from the US in to the EU”.He told the audience: “There’s every chance it will never see the light of day and that’s why we have to press very hard to oppose it.”He added that if he ever became Prime Minister, he would take on Brussels by renationalising the railways despite EU legislation calling for more privatisation.Mr Corbyn explained that he was backing Remain after a life of fierce Eurosceptism as he wanted to try and reform the organisation from inside.Voters have gone to UKIP and to the SNP because they don’t see Labour as representing them anymoreLast night Jeremy Corbyn was criticised by one his closest allies for not doing enough to win back lost working class voters.Jon Lansman -- who ran the hard-left socialist’s leadership campaign -- admitted that Labour “alienated our core voters, millions of them."They’ve gone to Ukip and to the SNP because they don’t see Labour as representing them anymore.”Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: “What Jeremy’s got to do now is he's got to come up with a positive programme, not opposition to what the Tories are doing.”The boss of the hard-left Momentum group claimed the Shadow Chancellor was doing a better job than the hapless Labour leader.“It’s actually John McDonnell who is leading on that stuff, and yes I think there’s a lot already that’s come out, but there’s a lot more work to do,” he said.Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

We urge you to make history and win back Britain’s freedom…believe in yourself and our country’s greatness – vote LEAVE2016-6-22TODAY you can make history — by winning Britain’s independence from the crushing might of the Brussels machine.We urge you to vote Leave . . . and make today our Independence Day.For many of us it will be the first vote of our lifetimes that truly matters.This referendum is not about parliamentary seats, so many of which are safely sewn up for one party or another.Today, every vote counts equally.And your decision is yours alone.For months you have been bombarded by propaganda from both Remain and Leave.But, with the referendum now here, we say this to Sun readers:Cut through all the guff.What does your gut tell you?Is leaving the EU best for you?For your family?For your community?For your country?Our deal with Brussels will never improve, despite David Cameron’s belated claims.The EU’s bullying ­President Jean-Claude Juncker made that plain yesterday.So ask yourself this:Do you trust Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, to stand on its own two feet and thrive as it trades with the seven billion people living outside the EU?Do you trust our elected politicians to run Britain without being overseen by the EU and its courts?Do you trust them, if we leave and regain our sovereignty, to bring immigration down to levels Britain can cope with?We on The Sun say YES to all three.Scare stories will be proven wrong Put aside what the Prime Minister thinks is best for us.Likewise the Beckhams, Doctor Who and James Bond.What unites all the famous faces who have lobbied for Remain — and, in ­fairness, Leave — is that they will still be ­personally rich and secure whatever decision Britain takes.But the nation’s working people have been told to fear for their jobs outside the EU.To fear for their families’ financial security and prospects.Even to fear for their safety.Those scare stories have been shameful, cynical and baseless.The Sun thinks they will prove 100 per cent wrong.We believe our future will ultimately be more prosperous as a fully independent nation, tradingindependently and run solely by politicians WE can all elect and kick out.Every other democracy outside the EU holds these basic principles dear.Why should Britain continue to surrender ours?Why is it deemed “insular” and ­“narrow-minded” to want only what America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have?Ignore Remain’s well-orchestrated ­propaganda and its moral lectures.Trust your instincts.Believe in yourself and the greatness of Britain . . . and vote Leave today.You will never have another chance.

Our vital debate2016-6-18WE applaud everything David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn said about Jo Cox ­yesterday and the manner in which they came together to say it.It is entirely right, too, that the by-election caused by her death be uncontested.Labour had an exceptional MP in Batley and Spen and deserve to be able to replace her without a fight.The Tory and Labour leaders said Jo’s murder was an attack on our democracy and, whatever its motive, so it was.For the sake of that democracy it is vital the referendum campaign restarts quickly and with a new emphasis on civility.Britain must look to debate these vital issues with passion but without the bile of the last few months.Jo was a champion of free speech who was campaigning hard for Remain and would have wanted her side to have every moment of the final week to press its case.The nation is still in shock over the senseless loss of a wife, mother and politician with potential as a major figure in Westminster.But we also have our most important decision in a generation to make in just five days.With the polls as tight as they seem, the millions of voters still on the fence could determine our nation’s future.Both sides need to win them round. The debate must go on. THE attack on Leave voters by IMF head Christine Lagarde betrays a fundamental ignorance of them and our EU debate.Put aside that her predictions about the economy and job losses are mere fortune-telling — former Bank of England governor Mervyn King says economic forecasts are a waste of time and we tend to agree.What is more ill-judged is Ms Lagarde saying she always admired British “openness to other nationalities and cultures” and it was “hard to believe attitudes had changed in such a short space of time”.They haven’t, Ms Lagarde.Forget the excesses of a minority on the far right. The mainstream leaders of the Leave campaign, and their millions of supporters, simply want our elected politicians to be able to control immigration from the EU and for power to lie with them and not Brussels.They want relief for those communities, which Ms Lagarde ignores, that have borne the brunt of Britain’s rapid and vast population increase.And they seek only for Britain to be as independent as America, Canada, ­Australia and New Zealand — and to trade more freely with them and other big economies outside the EU.The IMF chief believes this would somehow make our nation insular, small-minded and intolerant.That is nonsense, a myth Remain seem happy to propagate, but the opposite of the truth.

JD Wetherspoon prints thousands of new pro-Brexit beer mats attacking George Osborne for EU referendum stance2016-6-20PUB chain JD Wetherspoon is printing thousands of new pro-Brexit beer mats attacking George Osborne over the EU referendum.The company’s founder Tim Martin, who is backing Leave in Thursday’s vote, is sending the Chancellor a series of questions and calling ‘cronyism’ bad for Britain.The firm are printing half a million mats to be sent to its 920 outlets in the final days of campaigning.Signed by Mr Martin, who is also Wetherspoon’s chairman, it reads: "Dear Mr Osborne, You say that you won the economic argument.“Many strongly disagree.”It goes on to say: "Democracy leads to prosperity and freedom - and the EU is increasingly undemocratic, with awful results in Greece, Spain and Portugal and 15 years' stagnation in Italy."Our European friends are being dragged down by Brussels' bureaucracy."Speaking about the beer mats, Mr Martin said: "Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have tried to fool the public using scare stories from cronies or subordinates."Their main economic case relies on these people and their views are not independent or believable."Cameron yet again deliberately uses images of fear and destruction."He is under-estimating the intelligence of the public, who will not swallow this guff."The beer mat takes aim at bodies like the IMF, the OECD and the Bank of England, all of whom have predicted a negative outcome for the economy if there is a vote to leave the EU on Thursday.Mr Martin has previously tried to convince drinkers to back a Brexit after they printed 200,000 beer mats attacking IMF chief Christine Lagarde last month.CRONYISM IS BAD FOR BRITAIN - a few questions for George Osborne:Dear Mr Osborne,You say that you won the economic argument. Many strongly disagree.Democracy leads to prosperity and freedom - and the EU is increasingly undemocratic, with awful results in Greece, Spain and Portugal and 15 years' stagnation in Italy.Our European friends are being dragged down by Brussels' bureaucracy.I think that you are relying too much on cronies, whose organisations did not predict the last downturn and who don't realise what they don't know.You rely on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), HM Treasury and the Bank of England to support the 'Remain' case, yet:1. You officially nominated your friend (in January) Christine Lagarde, as head of the IMF.2. The OECD is funded by the EU, and you are a friend of its head - Jose Angel Gurria.3. You, George Osborne, are the boss of HM Treasury.4. You employed Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England.Does the nation not deserve more independent advice? 

What will Brexit mean for migration?2016-6-21BREXIT would stop the automatic right of European Union citizens being able to live and work in Britain.Instead if they want to come here they would need to apply under an Australian-style points based system where they would be judged on the skills they could bring to Britain.Boris Johnson says this would be a balanced policy as it would put everyone across the world on an equal footing.He says the EU policy is unfair as it discriminates against people who live outside the bloc.As well as EU citizens not being able to simply move here to live, Britons may find it more difficult if they decide they want to live in an EU country.It has not been announced but the EU may decide to make Britons apply for a visa, instead of just being able to settle.Labour MP John Mann says voting to leave the EU is the best option as he believes the free movement of people continues to undermine pay and conditions in working class communities.And he says it is not sustainable to have 300,000 new people added to the population ever year.One of David Cameron’s key election pledges was to bring net migration to below 100,000 but last month official figures revealed it has risen to the second highest level on record.Pro-Remain campaigner Jeremy Corbyn has admitted it will be impossible to put any limit on EU migrants if the country votes Remain.Mr Corbyn said the very principle of a single market across Europe is the free movement of people.The Labour leader’s confession comes as Migration Watch revealed immigration costs us £17billion a year.Most of this £17billion is for benefits to those from outside the EU.But Migration Watch said East European migrants cost as much as £1.5billion — given the difference between what they contribute to the economy and take out.David Cameron has said cutting ties with Brussels was a “bad way” to slash the number of immigrants coming to Britain.Speaking on a televised EU referendum debate he said they put a limit on the number of people coming here from outside the European Union for economic reasons.He said his crackdown on migrant benefits – where people will have to pay into the system before they are allowed to claim – will dissuade people from coming here and will relieve the pressure on Britain.We pay for your stories!

MEP Daniel Hannan explains why Britain has to vote Leave for the freedom we fought so hard for2016-6-22IF it hadn’t been for Britain, the EU would never have come into existence.If we hadn’t stood alone in 1940, Europe would have been united very differently.If we hadn’t played our part in defending the West against Stalin, democracy might have been snuffed out across the continent.We, of all people, need no lessons in being good Europeans.Again and again we have been prepared to fight for the freedom of other nations.Yet we’re now supposed to believe that we couldn’t thrive outside the EU. We, who set up free parliaments all over the world, are told we couldn’t make a success of things without the help of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and his officials.Right from the start, Remainers have had just one message, that Britain is too feeble to stand alone.We are, in the words of the Europhile actress Emma Thompson: “A tiny little cloud-bolted, rainy corner of sort-of Europe, a cake-filled, misery-laden grey old island.”Seriously, Emma? Tiny? In what sense? Economic might? Military power? Global reach? Geography?What are the big, powerful islands, then? Borneo? Madagascar?It’s this inferiority complex that we should vote to dispel tomorrow, this constant talking down of Britain.After all, if we can’t run our own affairs, who the hell can?We are the fifth largest economy in the world.We are a nuclear state, with the fourth largest military budget on the planet and a seat on the UN Security Council.We’re a leading member of the G7 and the G20, Nato and the Commonwealth.We have the world’s best universities and most widely studied language.Outside the EU, we can be more prosperous still.We’ll be free to strike our own trade deals with Commonwealth allies such as India and Australia.We’ll be able to cut fuel costs, making life easier for energy-intensive industries such as steel and plastics, cement and ceramics.We can cut food bills, helping household budgets and boosting the whole economy.Nowhere else in the world are countries expected to apologise for wanting to live under their own laws.The New Zealanders aren’t rushing to join Australia, but we don’t say: “Look at those nasty Australo-sceptics, clinging to their out-dated dream of sovereignty on their tiny little cake-filled islands.”The Japanese aren’t applying to join China, but we don’t say: “Why can’t you get over your empire, you bigoted Sino-sceptics on your misery-laden grey old islands?”Nowhere else in the world are countries expected to apologise for wanting to live under their own lawsEverywhere else it’s taken for granted that countries can trade and co-operate with friends on every continent while making their own decisions.Are we unable to do the same?Voting to leave the EU doesn’t mean turning our backs on Europe.We’ll still trade with our neighbours.We’ll still be military allies.Indeed, during this referendum, Britain has taken the decision to commit troops to the defence of Poland and Estonia, and rightly so.These countries will still be our friends whether or not we are in the EU.All we ask for is some powers back from Brussels.We want to take back control of our taxes, our laws, our money, our borders, our democracy.We want to be a good neighbour to the EU, not a bad tenant.If David Cameron had been able to get a looser deal earlier this year, things would be very different.The EU would have shown that it was prepared to listen.But the PM’s requests — powers returned, limits on immigration, exemptions for our key industries — were thrown back in his face.The EU can’t or won’t change.The only way to get a better deal is to vote to leave.The PM tells us we must vote for our children.Well, that’s exactly what I’ll be doing.Next month, my wife and I are expecting our third child.Like all parents, I have dreams for that baby.I want my children to live in a confident, independent country, engaged with every continent — including Europe.Above all, I want them to be able to hire and fire the people who pass our laws.Being a nation means we are not just a random set of individuals born to a different random set of individuals.Being a nation means we have a duty to keep intact the freedoms we were lucky enough to inherit from our parents and pass them on securely to our kids.In 1944 my late father volunteered to defend, with force of arms, our right to live under our own laws and our own people.I don’t want his grandchildren to lose that part of their birthright.Our song is not yet sung.We still have more to give.Vote Leave tomorrow for a global Britain — prosperous, independent and free.Daniel Hannan is MEP for South East England.

Migrants’ fears over what happens to them now after Britain chose Brexit in the EU referendum2016-6-24EU MIGRANTS are worried they face an uncertain future in Britain after last night’s historic referendum vote.Ending the free movement of people from the European Union was a big promise of the Leave campaign and, now they are victorious, this will happen.This has worried some migrants who have taken to social media to question whether they are going to get kicked out.But people already here need not worry as the Leave campaign has said, even after the Brexit negotiations are complete, those who are already in the UK will be allowed to stay.Vote Leave said: “There will be no change for EU citizens already lawfully resident in the UK.“These EU citizens will automatically be granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK and will be treated no less favourably than they are at present.”And without outlining the explicit terms of the proposed immigration system, in Boris Johnson’s victory speech this morning he said: “We cannot turn our backs on Europe.“We are part of Europe, our children and our grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling to the continent, understanding the languages and the cultures that make up our common European civilisation, continuing to interact with the peoples of other countries in a way that is open and friendly and outward looking.”And former Treasury economist Jonathan Portes says it would not be possible for Britain to deport EU migrants – for practical reasons.In a blog post the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research writes: “Remember that given we have no population register, and that EU nationals are not require to have visas, we won’t actually know who is here on June 23rd.“The only practical procedure would appear to be that suggested by Ukip's migration spokesman, Steven Woolf, that anyone who’d registered for a National Insurance number prior to the referendum would be guaranteed residence rights."Mr Portes added: “But even this will not address the more complex cases, of which there will be many thousand.“At the same time the government will need to try to address the understandable concerns of Britons abroad; of course it will have no direct control, but a generous offer to EU nationals here would help.”During the campaign period Vote Leave said its plan was to introduce an Australian-style points immigration system.This will mean people who want to come to the UK to work or study will be admitted on the basis of their skills without discrimination on the grounds of nationality.The immigration system will not be introduced until the UK has left the EU and in his speech this morning Mr Johnson said: “In voting to leave the EU, it is vital to stress there is no need for haste, and as the prime minister has said, nothing will change in the short term except how to give effect to the will of the people and to extricate this country from the supranational system.”Talks to get Britain to leave the EU are expected to take two years.

Boris Johnson tells The Sun’s cabbie Brits should send a massive signal to Europe by voting Leave2016-6-19BORIS Johnson has called on Brits to vote for Brexit to punish the EU for "cheating us” with a shoddy new deal.In an interview with The Sun’s Cabbie, the former London Mayor said other European leaders refused to listen to the nation’s desperate appeal for tougher immigration controls.Instead, the senior Tory insisted: “They tried to fob us off and it has not worked”.Calling for Brits to vote to leave on Thursday, Mr Johnson also said Brexit would help the rest of the EU, adding: “It would be a massive, massive signal to the rest of Europe that now is the time for change”.Boris also lashed out at Remain campaigners’ accusations that Brexit backers are racist as “incredibly offensive” during the interview in the back of the Sun Cab.Brexiteers are actually on the “anti-racist side of the argument” because EU immigration rules are “incredibly discriminatory against people who don’t come from Europe”, he explained.He also told real-life London taxi driver Grant Davis - who is still undecided how to vote - that Remain campaign bosses “are really trying to scare people” with doomsday scenarios of economic disasters under Brexit because they now fear defeat.BoJo explained: “They are and less confident about the outcome.“They are panicked about people suddenly looking up, lifting their eyes to the horizon and feeling a sense of confidence and excitement about what Britain can do”.It was “absolute rubbish” that his stand against David Cameron was just so he could take over as Tory leader, Boris also claimed.But he ducked Grant’s demands for guarantees that Brexit wouldn’t lead to job losses, and that Britain would be able to slash immigration to below 100,000 a year. THE CAB INTERVIEW:G: It is all getting a bit personal isn’t it? Last week, I was watching the telly and Amber Rudd, she said you are the life and soul of the party but she would not like you to be driving her home.What did she mean by that? What does she know about you Boris? You are not a pervert are you?B:  No, no. The crucial thing is that we are in a situation that we can’t control and at the moment.It is though I have got into an unlicensed mini-cab, and the guy does not know which way to go, he does not speak very good English, and we are going into a destination I can’t control.That is exactly what is happening now with the EU Grant.G: If we come out, do you think that the rest of Europe - the people of Portugal, Spain - would demand a referendum like England?B: I think it would be a massive, massive signal to the rest of Europe that now is the time for change. They tried to get away with cheating us. They tried to get away with zero change in negotiation. They tried to fob us off and it has not worked.  It will strike a blow for freedom and democracy if you vote on Thursday.G: John Major has called you a court jester. Is that deserved?B: People will try to reduce this debate to personalities, when what we need to do is focus on the issues, and the facts.G:  How do you feel about them trying to give you a bit of kicking?B: As we say in Brussels, donnez moi a break.G: Sounds like something out of Only Fools and Horses.  What does that mean?B: Gimme a break – it doesn’t matter at all what people say, provided we get the facts over and give people the choice.  This is not about politicians, this is about the people of this country finally having a choice to express their views.  They are coming centre stage now.G: Lots of cabbies have said a lot worse.B:  They certainly have, that is for sure.G: Why do you think David Cameron said we could survive outside the EU and now he says we can’t?B: Because I think they are panicked.  I think the Remain side is what we call jibbing.  They are panicked about people suddenly looking up, lifting their eyes to the horizon and feeling a sense of confidence and excitement about what Britain can do.G: Listen, I want to talk to you about immigration Boris.  We know with David Cameron he has been saying that a few years ago he is going to get immigration down to under 100,000, and he can’t do it.If we leave the EU, what guarantees can you give me and the readers of The Sun that you can get the immigration down?B: What we can guarantee is that we can bring in a points based system, an Australian style points based system so that politicians are actually able to deliver on their promises.At the moment people can stand up and say they are going to cut immigration to the tens of thousands when they do not have the legal ability to do that, and that is ridiculous.G: What do you think about people saying that if you are an outer you are a bit of a closet racist, you are a little Jonny Englander?  Do you think they have got a point?B: I think it is incredibly offensive.G: Is there a bit of xenophobia creeping in the out campaign?B: Absolutely not, because what we are calling for a balanced policy.  At the moment you could argue that the EU policy is incredibly discriminatory against people who don’t come from Europe and I think that is unfair. I think actually we are the anti-racist side of the argument.G: People in the cab have said to me, you know what this is about?  And I go, no, go on tell me.  And they say, it is all about Boris wanting to be in Number 10. Being the new Prime Minister.B: No.G: What do you say to that?B: Absolute rubbish. It suits people to try to turn it into a conversation about personalities.G: You think Remain are losing the argument Boris?B: I do. I think though that what we have seen in the last few days in particular is more and more panic by the In camp and I think they are less and less confident about the outcome, so they are really trying to scare people which is totally wrong.  You should not be running this country down, we can’t cope. We are a great country, we should believe in ourselves.G: It has come to my attention Boris that you dye your hair. Is it true?B: It is not. Unfortunately I thought the journalist in question was being ironic, so I gave what I thought was an ironic answer back.G: I thought you said you reached for the platinum blond bottle.B: No I don’t. I wouldn’t.  I never have done.GRANT'S VERDICT ON BORIS:“Boris is saying if we leave, it will be the promised land on everything. But is that really going to happen? I like him and I want to believe him, but I just don't know. What will we be left with if it all doesn't come true?”

10 reasons why choosing Brexit on June 23 is a vote for a stronger, better Britain2016-6-22BREXIT campaigners have listed 10 reasons why a vote for their side is for a stronger, better Britain.Below, we present the views of three experts who argue why leaving the EU on June 23 will save our sovereignty, rein in migration and boost our economy:The three key battlegrounds - sovereignty, migration and the economy - have dominated the TV debates, with polls consistently showing they are the topics uppermost in voters’ hearts and minds.Politicians from both sides have repeatedly tried to claim victory on all three fronts.But here our experts argue in each case, a vote for Brexit would be the best course of action for the UK:Our housing crisis will only get worseIMMIGRATION is a serious concern for ordinary voters.Net migration is running at a third of a million, nearly half of it from the EU.This poses massive challenges to ordinary, hard-working families who rely on local services but are already finding competition for them is fierce.Schools are so over-subscribed that many parents lose out on their first choices of education for their kids.Migrants register with a GP at a rate of one per minute, so waiting times for appointments are getting longer.We are a small island nation. Yet at the present rate of immigration we have to build one home every four minutes to house migrants and their families.Our ongoing housing crisis will only get worse.Young people are stuck at home with their parents, unable to save money for a deposit due to massive rents and unable to buy because prices are beyond their reach.We estimate that net migration is going to continue at the rate of 250,000 a year for the next 20 years if the UK votes to Remain.Sixty per cent of this will be from the EU.If we are right – and we have a good record predicting future immigration – our population will reach 70million in 2024 and 80million 20 years later.Even that massive increase assumes that Turkey will not join the EU, despite the British Government’s support for it.If we vote to Remain there will be no hope of reducing immigration from the EUIf it does eventually join, we are looking at another wave of immigration of some 100,000 a year.Why will net migration continue? The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that wages in Eastern Europe will not converge with the UK over the next 20 years, so there will continue to be a massive economic incentive to come to the UK, even for low-paid jobs.That incentive will be boosted in 2020 when the National Living Wage will be £9 an hour.This will mean even more competition for British workers.Of course, immigration from outside the EU is also high, at around 190,000.But the crucial point is that the Government can control who can come from these countries.There is more to be done but the Government has the powers.By contrast, if we vote to Remain there will be no hope of reducing immigration from the EU.The right to live and work here will be set in stone, with nothing our politicians can do.Naturally, we will still want skilled doctors and engineers to come from Europe, but that could continue under the system of work permits that we recommend.This would reduce EU migration by around 100,000 a year and maximise the economic benefit to Britain, while minimising the population pressures.As the debate has developed, it has become increasingly clear that the In campaigners have nothing to suggest about how to deal with the mass immigration that has gone on for far too long.Now we are in the final few days before the referendum, there are many issues to consider before voting.But if immigration remains one of your major concerns, there is at least a clear dividing line between the campaigns.Power is going to the people we can't sackBRITAIN’S greatest export, our chief contribution to human happiness, is parliamentary democracy.Our ancestors hit on the idea that instead of making up the rules as they went along, the people in charge should follow rules set by the nation at large.British history is the story of how we gradually took power away from the elites.As power spreads, the people in charge find it harder to rig the rules. The country as a whole becomes freer, fairer and richer.Countries around the world have flourished by copying the British model. But we are losing it at home.Power is shifting to Brussels, from people we can sack to people we can’t.That wouldn’t matter so much if the EU was simply a free trade area.But it aims to become a country called Europe.Back in 1975, we voted to join a common market — those words actually appeared on the ballot paper.Since then, Eurocrats have dropped any pretence of the main interest being in trade.The European Economic Community became the European Union.It got its hands on most of the things that go with being a nation: A parliament and supreme court, a currency and tax system, a president and foreign minister, a national anthem and flag.Britain has lost its sovereignty to the EU.The EU aims to become a country called EuropeSovereignty is something we haven’t heard much about during this campaign.The referendum has mainly been fought on immigration and the economy.But both are really about sovereignty. In other words, both are really about who gets to decide.Why couldn’t David Cameron keep his promise to hold net immigration below 100,000 a year? Because it’s up to Brussels, not Britain.If Parliament passed a law limiting the number of EU settlers to 100,000, that law would be struck down by our own judges, who have to give EU law primacy.The 100,001st applicant would claim his residence rights — and welfare and voting rights — from British courts. That’s what losing sovereignty means.It’s a similar story when it comes to the economy. What’s at stake isn’t just which policies we follow, it’s who gets to set them.Plenty of groups have suffered from EU rules, including steelworkers. In each case, Britain is forced to apply laws which damage us.Who does best out of the system? Those lobbies and vested interests that can get their way in Brussels without having to worry about the voters. Look at who is funding Remain: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citibank and Morgan Stanley.The multinationals and megabanks have spent millions pushing through EU rules that suit them.No wonder they’re terrified of leaving. So are the failed British politicians who turned to Brussels after losing here.Democracies such as Japan wouldn’t dream of subjecting themselves to foreign rule.Are we uniquely unable to run our own affairs? What kind of people do Remainers think we are?Others will be desperate to trade with usIF you listen to the Government’s Project Fear campaign, you’d be convinced that Brexit would result in economic Armageddon for the UK.But not only is this view blatant scaremongering, it is economically illiterate.I co-chair Economists for Brexit, a group of eight independent leading economists who are convinced of the strong economic case for leaving the EU.Our models calculate we would gain four per cent more GDP from free trade, and even more on top because of less regulation.The EU loves regulation. The Working Time Directive tells us how long to work. In finance, the EU tells firms how much they can pay.Its energy policy makes us build lines of eyesore windmills which cost a bomb.This regulation is there to suit the big businesses that lobby Brussels all the time — favours for favours, cutting out the dynamic small and innovative businesses.It is obvious that Brexit — with its lower prices, free trade and more competition — must be good for an economyIt is a cosy world. No wonder the establishment is so keen to keep it.Meanwhile, the EU’s economic policies have wreaked havoc all over the Continent. Greece has seen its economy ruined, while youth unemployment in Southern Europe has been driven into the stratosphere.Protectionist policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy raise the prices we pay in our shops by about eight per cent — or about £40 per household adult.In contrast, our forecasts show that Brexit would make us more competitive, drive up living standards, reduce unemployment and increase our output.Against this the Treasury has mustered an international army of Establishment bureaucrats and modellers to persuade you it will be a disaster.This has been a shameless abuse of economic modelling and a blatant attempt to con the people.How did they do it? By using some pretty strange models and some ridiculous assumptions.It is obvious that Brexit — with its lower prices, free trade and more competition — must be good for an economy.The Remain camp have also turned their attention to trade deals.They claim we will never get a better deal with the EU and it will take us umpteen years to renegotiate all the wonderful deals we now have with countries through the EU.But trade deals with all these other economies are irrelevant to us because their effects are too small to impact the world prices we trade at.We need no trade deals to trade! We have never had a deal with the US, yet have successfully traded with them for nearly two centuries.Do not be fooled by Angela Merkel’s threats — the EU will continue to do business with us, countries such as Germany export far more to us than we do to them.We will have an amicable deal on trade because they, not we, need it.Brexit will bring new vigour and competition to our economy and, above all, will give us consumers much lower prices.

What will Brexit mean for migration?2016-6-21BREXIT would stop the automatic right of European Union citizens being able to live and work in Britain.Instead if they want to come here they would need to apply under an Australian-style points based system where they would be judged on the skills they could bring to Britain.Boris Johnson says this would be a balanced policy as it would put everyone across the world on an equal footing.He says the EU policy is unfair as it discriminates against people who live outside the bloc.As well as EU citizens not being able to simply move here to live, Britons may find it more difficult if they decide they want to live in an EU country.It has not been announced but the EU may decide to make Britons apply for a visa, instead of just being able to settle.Labour MP John Mann says voting to leave the EU is the best option as he believes the free movement of people continues to undermine pay and conditions in working class communities.And he says it is not sustainable to have 300,000 new people added to the population ever year.One of David Cameron’s key election pledges was to bring net migration to below 100,000 but last month official figures revealed it has risen to the second highest level on record.Pro-Remain campaigner Jeremy Corbyn has admitted it will be impossible to put any limit on EU migrants if the country votes Remain.Mr Corbyn said the very principle of a single market across Europe is the free movement of people.The Labour leader’s confession comes as Migration Watch revealed immigration costs us £17billion a year.Most of this £17billion is for benefits to those from outside the EU.But Migration Watch said East European migrants cost as much as £1.5billion — given the difference between what they contribute to the economy and take out.David Cameron has said cutting ties with Brussels was a “bad way” to slash the number of immigrants coming to Britain.Speaking on a televised EU referendum debate he said they put a limit on the number of people coming here from outside the European Union for economic reasons.He said his crackdown on migrant benefits – where people will have to pay into the system before they are allowed to claim – will dissuade people from coming here and will relieve the pressure on Britain.We pay for your stories!

Rage of the working class2016-6-24THE people have spoken. We have woken up to a new Britain.It is a momentous turning-point in our history.For the first time in 43 years our nation will stand on its own feet, free from the European Union.What David Cameron experienced yesterday was an explosion of anger from millions of working class people who cannot now be ignored.Some was directed at the EU he campaigned with such cynicism to stay in.More it was a howl of rage at the increasing hopelessness of their lives, their neglected communities and the gulf between them and the rich, ­powerful governing class which this Referendum has so starkly exposed.Our population has just rocketed by 513,273 in one year, 335,600 from migration. It is not racist to protest at the calamitous effect this is having on working people who bear the brunt of it.Prosperous middle class home owners in London love all the Polish plumbers and cleaners. For working people the influx has meant low pay, stagnant for a decade as housing costs have soared. It means schools and surgeries are full up.It means being branded “thick” by ­supposedly educated Remain supporters too dim themselves to see that the rational desire for our Government to control immigration has nothing — zero — to do with prejudice or narrow-mindedness.Liberals champion all disadvantaged people EXCEPT poor Brits. For them, they cannot hide their contempt.Who, then, has spoken for these ­communities? A handful of Labour and Tory MPs. The rest put aside their apparently minor differences, linked arms for Remain and treated Brexit voters like filth on their shoes.For Labour this looks terminal.It is now a party of metropolitan posers feigning concern about the poor yet without the slightest desire to get their hands dirty doing anything for them.The Tories vowed to be the workers’ party. Instead most lobbied to stay in the EU, pretending it would help working people when it has done the opposite.Chancellor George Osborne has been blinded by rosy job and GDP statistics. They tell you nothing about real life.Mr Cameron must rebalance his Government’s priorities. How can we spend £50billion on a rail line, or £12billion a year on foreign aid, while our own poor cannot buy a home, pay the rent or get their kids into the local school?The Tories must put billions into equipping OUR communities with the infrastructure to cope with a population soaring out of control.Working people have no power beyond the vote they cast yesterday.Well they have exercised that power now and given themselves a glimmer of hope.

Civil war Tories roll out plot to protect Cameron’s leadership as Bojo and Gove back him regardless of EU result2016-6-23SENIOR Tories last night began a major operation to save David Cameron’s Premiership from the ruins of his party’s EU referendum civil war.The PM will lead the peace drive personally with an address to the nation from No10’s steps early this morning soon after the historic vote’s result is announced.Senior aides said last night his statement will be “unifying and healing”.He will also offer major olive branches in a bid to reunite furious Brexit-backing MPs, as well as the many millions who voted for Leave or Remain and are left bitterly disappointed.But it also emerged last night that a group of loyal Tory MPs who were backing Leave have been amassing dozens of signatures from their Brexit-supporting colleagues to put in a letter calling for Mr Cameron to stay on in Downing Street, no matter what the result is.LIVE UPDATES: For all the latest on the referendum resultsThe pro-EU Premier will face deafening calls to resign if Britain votes to walk away from Brussels for misjudging the will of the nation.Some angry senior Eurosceptics also say the bad blood which his ‘Project Fear’ attacks on Leave arguments have whipped up mean he is unable to command the whole party’s respect ever again.But the letter, dubbed ‘Operation Save Dave’ by some, is a determined bid to head off any leadership challenge.Two thirds of all Brexit-backing Tory MPs have signed it so far -- 84 out of 128.They included some of the Leave campaign’s biggest beasts such as Cabinet ministers Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, John Whittingdale and Priti Patel, plus former London Mayor and leadership rival Boris Johnson.Speaking out to back the PM as the polls closed last night, Commons Leader Mr Grayling told The Sun: “The most important thing for the Conservative Party is reunite, follow wishes of electorate, and get behind David Cameron as we do so, whatever the result”.A Brexit-backing senior minister added: “A leadership challenge and a new contest that goes on for months is the very last thing we need right now, even if the result is Brexit.“We need stability, not least to keep the markets under control.”The MP who organised the letter, former Foreign Office minister Robert Syms, said: “All of us are anxious to pull together.“We want a stable government to continue and for David Cameron to carry the 2015 manifesto.”But No10 fears the letter may also highlight deep divisions that remain in the party.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith who resigned in fury from the Cabinet in March had not signed it by yesterday afternoon.Another of the PM’s bitter critics, sacked former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, has pointedly refused to sign it.A leadership challenge and a new contest that goes on for months is the very last thing we need right now, even if the result is BrexitOne MP also told The Sun they had signed the letter but would vote to oust David Cameron in a no-confidence vote if 50 rebels club together to force one, and expects others to do the same.The MP said: “If there is a no-confidence vote then Cameron is in trouble.“Many of us who signed the letter in public would vote against him in the privacy of the ballot box.”Other MPs told of deeper anger with George Osborne, who is seen to be behind some of the most heavy handed Brexit scare stories.Several are calling for the Chancellor to be moved from the Treasury in the PM’s reshuffle.No10 sources dismissed claims that he had written two different speeches depending on the referendum result.Instead, Mr Cameron is waiting to hear the final result and crucially the margin of victory before he decides exactly what to say at dawn.If we stay in the EU, the PM will pledge to keep pushing for major reform in Brussels including on the free movement rule to curb immigration.No10 aides have also suggested making Leave boss Mr Gove his Deputy Prime Minister in an immediate gesture to Brexit backers.But Mr Cameron is expected to wait until at least after the weekend before making any changes to the government.He may also postpone an expected reshuffle until September — or even as late as 2017 — to use the spectre of sackings and promotions to keep his MPs in line.No10 also plans to roll out a series of major announcements and decisions in other policy areas over the next month in a bid to divert attentions from the EU.A decision on whether to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport is now expected in two weeks time.And the long-awaited Chilcot report into the Iraq war will be published on July 6.A vote on renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent may also be rushed forward in a bid to unite Tory MPs against divided

EU laws mean Theresa May has to beg the courts to kick an Italian killer out of Britain2016-6-21THERESA May was today forced to beg the courts to boot out a brutal Italian killer allowed to stay in the UK by “mad” EU laws.In a desperate last ditch bid, the Home Secretary urged judges to overturn an order from 2012 blocking the deportation of a convicted criminal known only as ‘FV’.The Italian national was convicted of the manslaughter of his flatmate Edward Mitchell in 2002 after striking him around the head 20 times with weapons including a hammer.He also strangled him with the flex from an iron.The charge was reduced to manslaughter for reasons of provocation.But after being released from prison the Home Office was told four years ago that he could not be deported as it was “unlawful” under EU free movement law – giving him a right to citizenship and permanent residence having built up a life in Britain.This is despite him breaching a suspended sentence for “battery” just months before.Brexit-backing Justice Minister Dominic Raab said the case highlighted the “skewed moral compass” at the heart of EU free movement rules.He blasted: “An EU national convicted of brutally killing someone in this country, by hammering and strangling them to death, can’t be removed on the basis of the conviction by a UK court.“It’s dangerous and undemocratic.”He added that David Cameron in opposition had slammed the legal position as “complete madness”. And he said: “The Prime Minister is absolutely right.“The only way to restore some sanity is to vote leave and take back control of our borders.”A judgement from the Supreme Court is not expected until long after Thursday’s Referendum.But it comes just two weeks after the Brexit campaign published a dossier of 50 killers Britain has been prevented from deporting because of EU free movement laws giving EU nationals the right to stay in the UK.One was convicted murderer Learco Chindamo was murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence in 1995 when he went to help a 13 year-old boy who was being attacked.In 2007 Justice Collins said removing Chindamo would be “disproportionate” under EU law. At the time, then opposition leader David Cameron said: “This does seem to be complete madness.”Government sources yesterday claimed the Home Office is challenging the 2012 verdict to argue that a prison sentence should be treated as a period out of the UK – thereby breaking his right to residence.The Italian – ‘FV’ – was sentenced to 8 years in prison in 2002. He had previous convictions for assault on police, drunk driving and driving while disqualified.He was released to hostel accommodation in 2006, but as no place was available, he received £25,000-worth of damages for the unlawful imprisonment which followed.

What will happen now that Britain has left the EU?2016-6-24SO what happens now Britain has left the European Union?If you believe everything the Remain campaign has said you better batten down the hatches in preparation for a plague of locusts, the four horsemen of the apocalypse and a tidal wave of economic woes which are set to hit UK shores.Whereas Brexiteers claim we will now be like a freed “hostage” and rid of the “guzzling orgy of backslapping” Brussels bureaucrats.They claim we will be able to make Britain great again by taking back control of the billions sent to the EU every year, free to make our own laws and trade deals with the rest of the world.This morning leading EU politicians meet for crunch talks at 8.30am.The tug-of-war will now be over when Article 50 is triggered - the mechanism for leaving the EU.Once this is in motion the EU is notified of the UK's intention to withdraw.While EU bureaucrats will want this to kick in immediately to avoid a drawn out period of uncertainty, the PM and certainly Leave campaigners will want this to drag on for a significant period of time to negotiate informally with the other 27 member states.George Osborne has previously said this could in fact take place within two weeks whereas Vote Leave want this to be delayed so negotiations over the UK's withdrawal can be given longer to run.The process could take up to two years to take place with Liam Fox this morning suggesting negotiations might even spill over into 2019.The markets are set for a Brexit "bloodbath" this morning when they open at 8am, with sterling at a 30-year low at $1.33.The markets have reacted with every twist and turn of the referendum and unsurprisingly the pound has plummeted ever since Leave has looked on the cards.So expect more fireworks today. Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney is expected to make a statement this morning.Most economists had predicted a sharp drop in the value of the Pound if the UK voted to Leave, with even Brexiteers admitting there would be a slight “blip” in the event of leaving the EU.Brexit panic appears to be sweeping across the world markets with Japan shutting down trading briefly today after the share index fell by 1,000 points.Could further economic woes be in store?David Cameron will make a statement this morning to clarify his position.He has previously pledged to stay on, but will he have the fortitude to stick at it and lead negotiations on a position he doesn't believe in?Or will he be forced to resign by Brexit-backing Tories? Only time will tell.Tory big beasts have written a letter to David Cameron pleading with him to stay on, but backbench MPs aren't quite so forgiving of his tactics during the EU referendum campaign dubbed "Project Fear".Around 80 Tory MPs have already come out in support of the PM.It is unlikely he will be forced out of No10 before negotiations over the UK’s withdrawal are well under way with the leading Leavers demanding a period of “stability” in the event of a Brexit.What we do know for certain is that the PM is planning on quitting before the 2020 election and a vote to Leave would almost certainly bring his departure date forward.Leaving the EU is not as simple as pushing a button and it is unclear how the process will pan out – Greenland being the only part of a country to have ever left.Leaving will have to be negotiated with the other 27 members and the UK’s subsequent relationship with the EU is also on the table, including future trade deals.This involves rescinding the European Communities Act which allows EU laws to trump the UK’s and also sifting through around 80,000 pages of EU agreements from over five decades to decide which are repealed, amended or retained. Parliament will also want a say in this.This process could last up to two years, during which EU laws will still apply, Britain carries on paying into EU coffers and UK borders remain open to EU workers.Some Brexiteers want to stall triggering Article 50 to give the whole process more time - even stretching into 2019.Throughout the campaign some Brexiteers have been privately keen to put staying in the single market at the heart of any renegotiations with Brussels.In a recent interview Boris Johnson said he wanted “access” rather than membership of the single market.If the UK is able to negotiate such a deal it would be a “Single Market-Lite” model, paying tariffs or taxes in order to trade with the EU.Britain would also offer to maintain part of its £8.5billion a year contribution to the EU budget.In return Britain would expect to be able to withdraw from the free movement of people but allow a lesser “free movement of labour” which allows workers from the EU to come to the UK with a firm job offer.But in a stark warning to Britain, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the UK would be treated as a “third party” and have no access.Britain will leave the EU after two years from the date Article 50 is triggered, giving the PM time to strike new trade deals.Any deal has to be agreed by a majority of foreign government ministers on the council of the European Union, then ratified by member states before being agreed by European Parliament (separate to the council) and MPs at Westminster -  no wonder it will take up to two years.Remain campaigners claim if no agreement is struck, the UK will be left to trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules which would mean exporters are hit with their uniform import taxes or tariffs.But Leave campaigners say it is not in the EU’s interests to lose access to the British markets for its member states’ consumer goods and will be keen to strike a deal.The shock result has barely had time to sink in, but Nicola Sturgeon is already making noises about a Scottish break-away.Now it's clear Scotland almost unanimously voted to Remain and England choosing to Leave, the SNP will say it shows further evidence of a deepening divide between the will of the two nations.First Minister Ms Sturgeon stated that the Scottish people had made it "clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union".She has previously said this could be the "material change" in circumstances to prompt an independence referendum.Her predecessor Alex Salmond also piled in saying he was "quite certain" Ms Sturgeon would now be calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence.But pollsters suggest there is little change in the appetite for an independent Scotland since the last referendum. Then again - what do pollsters know?

Switzerland WITHDRAWS its application to enter EU…just one week before Brexit vote2016-6-16POLITICIANS in Switzerland have voted to withdraw the country’s long-standing EU application because only “a few lunatics” would want to join the European Union now.Thomas Minder, counsellor for Schaffhausen state and an active promoter of the concept of “Swissness” told a Swiss newspaper, Neue Zurcher Zeitung, he was eager to “close the topic fast and painlessly” as only “a few lunatics” may want to join.A total of 27 members of parliament’s upper house voted to invalidate the 1992 application – a week before Britain decides on its own EU membership.The original motion, introduced by the conservative Swiss People’s Party MP, Lukas Reimann, received overwhelming support from law-makers back in March, with 126 National Council deputies voting in favour.But Switzerland will now give formal notice to the EU to consider its application withdrawn.Hannes Germann, also representing Schaffhausen, compared the withdrawal to the symbolic importance to Iceland’s decision to drop its membership bid in 2015.“Iceland had the courage and withdrew the application for membership, so no volcano erupted,” he said.Switzerland’s long-standing application to join has had little impact on domestic politics for more than 20 years, after it suspended accession negotiations in 1992, following a referendum to join the European Economic Area.However, the Swiss public narrowly rejected EEA membership.Some have even argued that the vote was unnecessary because the EU no longer regards the country as an official candidate to join.Filippo Lombardi, from the Christian Democratic People’s Party, said it was "not very clever to discuss it once again," calling the whole thing "a bit ridiculous".Switzerland, never a member of EU, shares free trade with the union and free movement of people as part of the Schengen zone.The British public will have their say on the country’s EU membership through a much anticipated referendum on Thursday.

Jeremy Corbyn admits limiting immigration is IMPOSSIBLE if we remain in the EU2016-6-19JEREMY Corbyn has admitted it will be impossible to put any limit on EU migrants if the country votes Remain.The Labour leader’s confession, coming as Migration Watch revealed immigration costs us £17billion a year, is a huge boost for Brexit.Remain-supporting Mr Corbyn made his comments after being asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr if any kind of upper limit could be put on EU migrants.He said: “I don’t think you can have one while you have free movement of labour.“The very principle of a single market across Europe is the free movement of people.”Mr Corbyn, who has a history of Euroscepticism despite his support for Remain, appeared to slap down his deputy Tom Watson.Mr Watson last week called for reforms to EU immigration rules to relieve pressure on communities. There has been a lazy assumption that immigrants are unquestionably an economic benefit to the UKMr Corbyn’s admission also angered senior Labour figures, who already fear scores of supporters will back Brexit because of immigration worries.One senior Labour source said: “I don’t mean to be a conspiracy theorist but you actually wonder if he’s trying to win this for Brexit.”Mr Corbyn said rather than restrict free movement the EU needed to develop policies to help poor workers stay in their home countries.And he suggested British voters worried about the effect of immigration on their local areas should instead blame the Tories for failing to invest in new hospitals and schools.Brexit campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said: “Finally some honesty from the In campaign, with an admission there is no upper limit on the levels of migration while we remain in the EU.”Migration Watch yesterday said immigration costs the Treasury £17billion a year.Most of it is for benefits to those from outside the EU.But it said East European migrants cost as much as £1.5billion — given the difference between what they contribute to the economy and take out.Migration Watch’s Lord Green said: “There has been a lazy assumption that immigrants are unquestionably an economic benefit to the UK — but this very much depends on where they came from and when they arrived.”Mr Corbyn’s comments came as Chancellor George Osborne admitted the Government may only be able to bring net migration down to 180,000 in the coming years — way above David Cameron’s promise to get below 100,000.Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

10 reasons why choosing Brexit on June 23 is a vote for a stronger, better Britain2016-6-22BREXIT campaigners have listed 10 reasons why a vote for their side is for a stronger, better Britain.Below, we present the views of three experts who argue why leaving the EU on June 23 will save our sovereignty, rein in migration and boost our economy:The three key battlegrounds - sovereignty, migration and the economy - have dominated the TV debates, with polls consistently showing they are the topics uppermost in voters’ hearts and minds.Politicians from both sides have repeatedly tried to claim victory on all three fronts.But here our experts argue in each case, a vote for Brexit would be the best course of action for the UK:Our housing crisis will only get worseIMMIGRATION is a serious concern for ordinary voters.Net migration is running at a third of a million, nearly half of it from the EU.This poses massive challenges to ordinary, hard-working families who rely on local services but are already finding competition for them is fierce.Schools are so over-subscribed that many parents lose out on their first choices of education for their kids.Migrants register with a GP at a rate of one per minute, so waiting times for appointments are getting longer.We are a small island nation. Yet at the present rate of immigration we have to build one home every four minutes to house migrants and their families.Our ongoing housing crisis will only get worse.Young people are stuck at home with their parents, unable to save money for a deposit due to massive rents and unable to buy because prices are beyond their reach.We estimate that net migration is going to continue at the rate of 250,000 a year for the next 20 years if the UK votes to Remain.Sixty per cent of this will be from the EU.If we are right – and we have a good record predicting future immigration – our population will reach 70million in 2024 and 80million 20 years later.Even that massive increase assumes that Turkey will not join the EU, despite the British Government’s support for it.If we vote to Remain there will be no hope of reducing immigration from the EUIf it does eventually join, we are looking at another wave of immigration of some 100,000 a year.Why will net migration continue? The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that wages in Eastern Europe will not converge with the UK over the next 20 years, so there will continue to be a massive economic incentive to come to the UK, even for low-paid jobs.That incentive will be boosted in 2020 when the National Living Wage will be £9 an hour.This will mean even more competition for British workers.Of course, immigration from outside the EU is also high, at around 190,000.But the crucial point is that the Government can control who can come from these countries.There is more to be done but the Government has the powers.By contrast, if we vote to Remain there will be no hope of reducing immigration from the EU.The right to live and work here will be set in stone, with nothing our politicians can do.Naturally, we will still want skilled doctors and engineers to come from Europe, but that could continue under the system of work permits that we recommend.This would reduce EU migration by around 100,000 a year and maximise the economic benefit to Britain, while minimising the population pressures.As the debate has developed, it has become increasingly clear that the In campaigners have nothing to suggest about how to deal with the mass immigration that has gone on for far too long.Now we are in the final few days before the referendum, there are many issues to consider before voting.But if immigration remains one of your major concerns, there is at least a clear dividing line between the campaigns.Power is going to the people we can't sackBRITAIN’S greatest export, our chief contribution to human happiness, is parliamentary democracy.Our ancestors hit on the idea that instead of making up the rules as they went along, the people in charge should follow rules set by the nation at large.British history is the story of how we gradually took power away from the elites.As power spreads, the people in charge find it harder to rig the rules. The country as a whole becomes freer, fairer and richer.Countries around the world have flourished by copying the British model. But we are losing it at home.Power is shifting to Brussels, from people we can sack to people we can’t.That wouldn’t matter so much if the EU was simply a free trade area.But it aims to become a country called Europe.Back in 1975, we voted to join a common market — those words actually appeared on the ballot paper.Since then, Eurocrats have dropped any pretence of the main interest being in trade.The European Economic Community became the European Union.It got its hands on most of the things that go with being a nation: A parliament and supreme court, a currency and tax system, a president and foreign minister, a national anthem and flag.Britain has lost its sovereignty to the EU.The EU aims to become a country called EuropeSovereignty is something we haven’t heard much about during this campaign.The referendum has mainly been fought on immigration and the economy.But both are really about sovereignty. In other words, both are really about who gets to decide.Why couldn’t David Cameron keep his promise to hold net immigration below 100,000 a year? Because it’s up to Brussels, not Britain.If Parliament passed a law limiting the number of EU settlers to 100,000, that law would be struck down by our own judges, who have to give EU law primacy.The 100,001st applicant would claim his residence rights — and welfare and voting rights — from British courts. That’s what losing sovereignty means.It’s a similar story when it comes to the economy. What’s at stake isn’t just which policies we follow, it’s who gets to set them.Plenty of groups have suffered from EU rules, including steelworkers. In each case, Britain is forced to apply laws which damage us.Who does best out of the system? Those lobbies and vested interests that can get their way in Brussels without having to worry about the voters. Look at who is funding Remain: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citibank and Morgan Stanley.The multinationals and megabanks have spent millions pushing through EU rules that suit them.No wonder they’re terrified of leaving. So are the failed British politicians who turned to Brussels after losing here.Democracies such as Japan wouldn’t dream of subjecting themselves to foreign rule.Are we uniquely unable to run our own affairs? What kind of people do Remainers think we are?Others will be desperate to trade with usIF you listen to the Government’s Project Fear campaign, you’d be convinced that Brexit would result in economic Armageddon for the UK.But not only is this view blatant scaremongering, it is economically illiterate.I co-chair Economists for Brexit, a group of eight independent leading economists who are convinced of the strong economic case for leaving the EU.Our models calculate we would gain four per cent more GDP from free trade, and even more on top because of less regulation.The EU loves regulation. The Working Time Directive tells us how long to work. In finance, the EU tells firms how much they can pay.Its energy policy makes us build lines of eyesore windmills which cost a bomb.This regulation is there to suit the big businesses that lobby Brussels all the time — favours for favours, cutting out the dynamic small and innovative businesses.It is obvious that Brexit — with its lower prices, free trade and more competition — must be good for an economyIt is a cosy world. No wonder the establishment is so keen to keep it.Meanwhile, the EU’s economic policies have wreaked havoc all over the Continent. Greece has seen its economy ruined, while youth unemployment in Southern Europe has been driven into the stratosphere.Protectionist policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy raise the prices we pay in our shops by about eight per cent — or about £40 per household adult.In contrast, our forecasts show that Brexit would make us more competitive, drive up living standards, reduce unemployment and increase our output.Against this the Treasury has mustered an international army of Establishment bureaucrats and modellers to persuade you it will be a disaster.This has been a shameless abuse of economic modelling and a blatant attempt to con the people.How did they do it? By using some pretty strange models and some ridiculous assumptions.It is obvious that Brexit — with its lower prices, free trade and more competition — must be good for an economy.The Remain camp have also turned their attention to trade deals.They claim we will never get a better deal with the EU and it will take us umpteen years to renegotiate all the wonderful deals we now have with countries through the EU.But trade deals with all these other economies are irrelevant to us because their effects are too small to impact the world prices we trade at.We need no trade deals to trade! We have never had a deal with the US, yet have successfully traded with them for nearly two centuries.Do not be fooled by Angela Merkel’s threats — the EU will continue to do business with us, countries such as Germany export far more to us than we do to them.We will have an amicable deal on trade because they, not we, need it.Brexit will bring new vigour and competition to our economy and, above all, will give us consumers much lower prices.

Fury as IMF head Christine Lagarde warns Britain to vote Remain… or face losing 500k jobs2016-6-17IMF CHIEF Christine Lagarde launched a blistering attack on Brexit-backers yesterday as the global watchdog said an ‘Out’ vote would trigger half a million job cuts.The French diplomat said she had always admired British “openness to other nationalities and cultures” and it was “hard to believe attitudes had changed in such a short space of time”.She added that it was only because of the EU that the UK had been transformed into a “dynamic and vibrant” economy – helped by “talented and hard-working” migrants.Brexit-supporters last night branded the comments “shameful” – and insisted they wanted to leave the EU to go global.Ms Lagarde’s blast came as the IMF said a Brexit would also plunge the UK into recession in 2017, shrink the economy by almost 6 per cent and send inflation sky high.A doom-laden report said added that there would be “permanently lower” household incomes and any saving from leaving the EU would be more than offset by the huge hit to trade.IMF officials added there would “inevitably” be a big cut to the size of the public sector.Overall, the unemployment rate would rise under a worst-case scenario from the current 5 per cent to 6.5 per cent in 2019 – around half a million jobs.Separately, Italian Matteo Renzi said he was convinced Brits were too clever to vote for a Brexit.He said: “I believe that the British are much wiser than what we see in the polls.”The row followed a bitter of war of words over an apocalyptic warning from the Bank of England on Thursday morning.Before Jo Cox’s horrific murder, Boris Johnson slammed Bank of England Governor Mark Carney for “talking Britain down” for saying a Brexit was the “largest immediate risk” to global financial markets.In a stark warning, the BoE said it was “increasingly likely” the Pound would collapse after a vote to leave.And the Bank said Brits were putting off buying cars and houses because they were so nervous about the possibility of an out vote.It triggered a furious response from former Tory Chancellors Lord Lawson and Norman Lamont who accused the BoE of “startling dishonesty”.The IMF report was due out on Thursday night before being delayed 24 hours in the wake of Jo Cox’s death.Speaking yesterday morning Ms Lagarde begged Brits to vote remain next week – but warned it was clear the risks of leaving were “firmly on the downside”.She said: “There is, in my view, a clear case as to how the UK has benefited – and will continue to benefit from its membership in the European Union.“Membership in the EU has made the UK a richer economy, but it has also made it a more diverse, more exciting and more creative country.”Her comments enraged Brexit supporters who were already livid at the timing of the intervention by the most powerful financial organisation in the world.UKIP Douglas Carswell called Ms Lagarde’s comments “shameful” and accused the Treasury of “choreographing” the report with the IMF.UK officials are limited in what they can say on EU membership by ‘purdah’ rules which kicked in 21 days ago.Mr Carswell told the Sun: “It’s shameful that people at the IMF are trying to misrepresent people supporting a vote to leave. People who want to leave want to go global, that’s the point.”He added: “The IMF thought the Euro would be a good thing, they thought the banks in 2006 were doing just fine that we were living within our means when we weren’t. They were wrong then, and they are wrong now.”Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott added: “The IMF has chosen to ignore the positive benefits of leaving the EU and instead focused only on the supposed negatives.”The IMF plotted two scenarios but said Britain would be worst off under both.Even a relatively smooth transition, would have “material” impact on growth and incomes.Under a “limited” impact, the IMF said Britain would adopt a Norway-style model where it signs up to the single market, has no influence in EU rule-making, but has to accept free movement of migrants.In a conference call, IMF officials said economists were in near universal agreement that a Brexit would be negative.But they admitted their forecasts assumed no action by the BoE to shore up the economy, such as an interest rate cut.The IMF’s moves came as EU leaders bombarded Brits with yet more warnings.Speaking in Russia alongside Vladimir Putin, Italian PM Matteo Renzi warned that if the UK leaves Europe “it is forever”.He said: “It’s not there is first a home match and then an away game.”But he added: “I think victory will be claimed by those who want to stay in Europe.”Separately German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble said Europe was well prepared to respond to current Brexit-related anxiety.EU Council chief Donald Tusk, Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and European Parliament chief Martin Schulz will hold a special meeting on June 24 – the day after the Referendum.The outcome of the historic poll is set to dominate a summit of member state leaders in Brussels on June 28-29.We pay for your stories!

Don’t let savagery of Jo Cox’s death hijack referendum2016-6-19DAVID CAMERON will spend the next four sleepless nights waiting for voters to decide whether he is In or Out . . . of Downing Street.Polls can be wrong.He might escape like Houdini, as he did in the 2014 Scottish referendum and last year’s General Election.But despite public dismay over the vile murder of Labour MP Jo Cox, the signs are that Britain will wave the European Union a sensational goodbye.The verdict rests with the one in eight wavering voters who cannot make up their minds.They include lifelong Eurosceptics who worry about appearing to keep the same company as Jo Cox’s alleged killer.But voters are no more tainted by other people’s madness than true soccer fans with the sozzled thugs creating havoc at the Euros.Extremism is unpopular here, but it is becoming mainstream in countries such as France, Germany, Holland and Austria, where voters feel trapped in an undemocratic EU.Hostility to Brussels is matched by envy of our chance to escape its clutches.If we go, others will follow.Jo Cox campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU.But as her friend and fellow Labour MP Rachel Reeves says: “I don’t think we should link the referendum to Jo’s death.”Thursday’s vote is too important to risk being diverted, even by an act of such appalling violence.This is about Britain’s future in a fast-changing world.There are respectable arguments on both sides.Half prefer the devil we know, for all its flaws.The other half wants to set our economy free to flourish outside the EU.The recent Brexit surge may have paused after last week’s savagery.But one poll suggests most people are “delighted” at the prospect of leaving the EU and would be disappointed if we remain.Another confirms Project Fear has rebounded disastrously against the PM and Chancellor George Osborne.We apparently have more faith in the truthfulness of Michael Gove and Boris Johnson than in our two most senior statesmen.This collapse in public trust is unlikely to change in the next four days.Voters watched the PM return humiliated and empty-handed from his battle to control our borders.They know he never considered leaving the EU despite “ruling nothing out”.They have seen Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy impoverished by the catas-trophic euro.And they witness the flood of migrants across borderless Europe, rich pickings for ruthless people-smugglers who condemn thousands to perish on the way.Whitehall is gearing up for changeThey also know, for all the Prime Minister’s promises and the Chancellor’s warnings, a vote to Remain would lock Britain into costly, ever-deeper political union with Brussels.We have been mugged into supporting whatever the EU does to prop up the stricken euro.Britain is guarantor to £80BILLION in liabilities if the single currency collapses.As EU members, we would have no choice but to cough up.A few weeks ago Brexit seemed a lost cause.Today Downing Street is secretly making contingency plans for divorce.Having strained every sinew to keep us inside the EU, Whitehall mandarin Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered Cabinet Office staff to prepare for Brexit.Whitehall is gearing up for change.Treasury, Foreign Office and Justice Department officials have been preparing for months.Anything less would be a grotesque dereliction of duty.By Friday there may be a new regime in Downing Street, with Mr Cameron on notice to quit.George Osborne’s time as Chancellor would be up.Philip Hammond would be out of his palatial Foreign Office suite.Even if Mr Cameron stayed until a new Tory leader was elected, the reins of power would shift to Brexit’s Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.They would require detailed advice on what to do next and how to do it.We are participating in a near-extinct EU phenomenon . . . democracy in action.With the greatest respect to Jo Cox, we should not allow her horrific murder to derail this unique and unrepeatable process.I’ll be using the opportunity to vote Out. So who should the Tories choose for leader if David Cameron goes?This is perhaps a question that requires an answer within days.The big money is on Boris Johnson, the most popular politician of the day. But so was Tony Blair in his time and look what happened to him.Boris has matured as a politician, curbing his tendency to make a joke out of everything.But the star of this campaign is Michael Gove, who has blossomed as one of the most articulate, authoritative voices in modern politics.He is that rare thing: The genuine article. Go Gove!

Migrants’ fears over what happens to them now after Britain chose Brexit in the EU referendum2016-6-24EU MIGRANTS are worried they face an uncertain future in Britain after last night’s historic referendum vote.Ending the free movement of people from the European Union was a big promise of the Leave campaign and, now they are victorious, this will happen.This has worried some migrants who have taken to social media to question whether they are going to get kicked out.But people already here need not worry as the Leave campaign has said, even after the Brexit negotiations are complete, those who are already in the UK will be allowed to stay.Vote Leave said: “There will be no change for EU citizens already lawfully resident in the UK.“These EU citizens will automatically be granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK and will be treated no less favourably than they are at present.”And without outlining the explicit terms of the proposed immigration system, in Boris Johnson’s victory speech this morning he said: “We cannot turn our backs on Europe.“We are part of Europe, our children and our grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling to the continent, understanding the languages and the cultures that make up our common European civilisation, continuing to interact with the peoples of other countries in a way that is open and friendly and outward looking.”And former Treasury economist Jonathan Portes says it would not be possible for Britain to deport EU migrants – for practical reasons.In a blog post the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research writes: “Remember that given we have no population register, and that EU nationals are not require to have visas, we won’t actually know who is here on June 23rd.“The only practical procedure would appear to be that suggested by Ukip's migration spokesman, Steven Woolf, that anyone who’d registered for a National Insurance number prior to the referendum would be guaranteed residence rights."Mr Portes added: “But even this will not address the more complex cases, of which there will be many thousand.“At the same time the government will need to try to address the understandable concerns of Britons abroad; of course it will have no direct control, but a generous offer to EU nationals here would help.”During the campaign period Vote Leave said its plan was to introduce an Australian-style points immigration system.This will mean people who want to come to the UK to work or study will be admitted on the basis of their skills without discrimination on the grounds of nationality.The immigration system will not be introduced until the UK has left the EU and in his speech this morning Mr Johnson said: “In voting to leave the EU, it is vital to stress there is no need for haste, and as the prime minister has said, nothing will change in the short term except how to give effect to the will of the people and to extricate this country from the supranational system.”Talks to get Britain to leave the EU are expected to take two years.

Corbyn facing Labour coup Up to 200 MPs could move to get rid of their leader after Brexit vote2016-6-24JEREMY Corbyn faces a Labour coup as up to 200 MPs launch a plot to oust him as leader as he claims: "I'm staying."As Brits voted for a Brexit, Dame Margaret Hodge told how Corbyn failed the leadership test with an "abysmal" performance during the EU referendum campaign.The Labour leader faces building pressure to quit as Brussels unleashes a backlash against David Cameron's slow-motion EU exit plan.Pro-Leave Labour MP and former minister Frank Field was the latest senior figure to break ranks and pour public scorn on Mr Corbyn's leadership abilities.Northern Labour MPs Angela Smith, Helen Goodman and Caroline Flint were also among those turning their back on Corbyn.Flint said he was not reaching the areas and the people, Labour depend on to win a general election.Former PM Tony Blair called Mr Corbyn’s contribution to Remain  pretty lukewarm and Lord Mandelson said the leader “can’t cut it”.Shockwaves from the UK's decision to vote to leave the European Union were felt across the world, as finances were hit in the aftermath.EU leaders hardened their stance to force Britain out of the union as fast as possible, while the White House insisted President Barack Obama stood by his controversial warning that London would be at the back of the queue for any trade deals.Westminster speculation that Mr Corbyn could use a speech on the aftermath of the referendum to announce his resignation was denied by Labour, despite many of the party's pro-Remain MPs expressing despair at what they see as his lacklustre performance in the campaign, ahead of a no confidence vote against him next week.Mr Field said told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "He clearly isn't the right person to actually lead the party into an election because nobody thinks he will actually win. We clearly need somebody who the public think of as an alternative prime minister."But last night Mr Corbyn insisted he wants to be PM and would stay leader. He said: “I’m carrying on. I’m making the case for unity.”.When asked this morning by ITV News whether he would be staying on, he said: "Absolutely I'm staying."He urged Dame Margaret to “think for a moment” before pressing on with her no confidence motion.He said he was elected with a “very large mandate . . . from the party members as a whole”.In a bid to shore up his leadership, Mr Corbyn will today deliver a speech on immigration. He has pulled out of a planned appearance at Glastonbury.Dan Jarvis, Keir Starmer and Chuka Umunna have all been talked up as Labour moderates who could challenge for leadership.When asked this morning by ITV News whether he would be staying on, he said: "Absolutely I'm staying."Scotland's SNP government was also launching a diplomatic offensive on the continent to remind EU chiefs that Scots voted overwhelmingly to stay in the bloc.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear she intends to use the referendum results to try to force a second independence vote when the negotiating situation becomes clearer.But eyes were all on the Prime Minister after he announced plans to quit his post by October.Tory Remain backers were getting behind Home Secretary Theresa May as the best placed candidate for a leadership battle with ex-London mayor Boris Johnson.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker insisted Britain's break from the EU was "not an amicable divorce", before adding sharply that it was never "a tight love affair anyway"."Britons decided that they want to leave the European Union, so it doesn't make any sense to wait until October to try to negotiate the terms of their departure - I would like to get started immediately," he said.The comments came as a prominent Leave advocate, Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, came under fire for saying a post-Brexit Britain could still join the single market with its free movement of labour rules.Mr Hannan claimed this was not a backtrack on campaign promises as he insisted the Leave side had promised to control immigration, not end it.However, Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke warned against a lurch to right-wing nationalism in the party as he attacked Ukip immigration policies.Britain's new status in the departure lounge of the EU was underlined by the exclusion of Mr Cameron from a meeting of the other 27 leaders next Wednesday to discuss the implications of Brexit.Under the Lisbon Treaty, London has the right to decide when it triggers Article 50, which begins the two-year exit negotiation period.The motion is discussed by Labour MPs at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP).The chair of the PLP can decide whether the motion should be debated.If he allows the vote there will be a secret ballot.The motion has no formal power to force a leader to resign but it would increase pressure on them to do so.If a leader refused to resign, 20% of the unhappy MPs could nominate a willing candidate to stand against the leader.If this threshold is reached, the party's National Executive Committee would decide the timetable for the contest .A spokesman for Mr Corbyn condemned the motion as a "self-indulgent act", although he acknowledged it had been discussed at a post-referendum meeting of the shadow cabinet.He said: "It is a time when our party should be uniting to deal with the real issues that face Britain and the real issues that face the people of Britain, and so to create divisions in the party is a bit of a self-indulgent act."We pay for your stories!

Switzerland WITHDRAWS its application to enter EU…just one week before Brexit vote2016-6-16POLITICIANS in Switzerland have voted to withdraw the country’s long-standing EU application because only “a few lunatics” would want to join the European Union now.Thomas Minder, counsellor for Schaffhausen state and an active promoter of the concept of “Swissness” told a Swiss newspaper, Neue Zurcher Zeitung, he was eager to “close the topic fast and painlessly” as only “a few lunatics” may want to join.A total of 27 members of parliament’s upper house voted to invalidate the 1992 application – a week before Britain decides on its own EU membership.The original motion, introduced by the conservative Swiss People’s Party MP, Lukas Reimann, received overwhelming support from law-makers back in March, with 126 National Council deputies voting in favour.But Switzerland will now give formal notice to the EU to consider its application withdrawn.Hannes Germann, also representing Schaffhausen, compared the withdrawal to the symbolic importance to Iceland’s decision to drop its membership bid in 2015.“Iceland had the courage and withdrew the application for membership, so no volcano erupted,” he said.Switzerland’s long-standing application to join has had little impact on domestic politics for more than 20 years, after it suspended accession negotiations in 1992, following a referendum to join the European Economic Area.However, the Swiss public narrowly rejected EEA membership.Some have even argued that the vote was unnecessary because the EU no longer regards the country as an official candidate to join.Filippo Lombardi, from the Christian Democratic People’s Party, said it was "not very clever to discuss it once again," calling the whole thing "a bit ridiculous".Switzerland, never a member of EU, shares free trade with the union and free movement of people as part of the Schengen zone.The British public will have their say on the country’s EU membership through a much anticipated referendum on Thursday.

Emotional scenes as Samantha Cameron watches her husband resign as Prime Minister2016-6-24DAVID Cameron's doting wife looked devastated as she watched her defeated husband resign as Prime Minister after losing his fight to stay in the European Union.Sobbing Samantha stood at the sidelines as a rock of support for the PM who admitted "this ship needs a new captain" following a vote for Brexit by millions of people across the UK.Cameron grabbed his wife's hand after an emotional three-minute speech outside Downing Street before disappearing through No 10 without answering any questions from the press."The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected," Cameron said."The country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction."He added: "I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination."This is not a decision I've taken lightly but I do believe it's in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required."Although there was sorrow for the Camerons, a joyful Boris Johnson said the Brexit vote is a“glorious opportunity” to regain power over our borders and laws hours.The former London Mayor praised his fellow Tory and old friend as “one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age” in a press conference for the victorious Vote Leave campaign just hours after his resignation.Gove applauded the PM for leading the UK with "courage, dignity and grace"."He deserves to be remembered as a great Prime Minister," he added.Johnson said: "I believe we now have a glorious opportunity - we can pass our laws and set our taxes entirely to the needs of the UK economy"We can control our borders in a way that is not discriminatory, but fair and balanced and take the wind out of the sails of the extremists and those who would play politics with immigration."Above all, we can find our voice in the world again... powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary force for good in the world."As a three-month contest begins for Conservative leadership, Labour was also plunged deeper into a crisis as MPs call for Jeremy Corbyn to resign as leader.Some said he should be forced to quit after his "seemingly half-hearted" support for the UK to remain in the European Union.One senior MP said: “He is toast."If we go into a general election with him as leader, we will be wiped out. The shadow cabinet has got to tell him to go.”Another added: “Jeremy’s campaign and its focus on freedom of movement showed he clearly does not understand the mood of the country."Labour should be looking for a new leader.”Members of the Labour Party have this afternoon submitted a no-confidence motion in leader Jeremy Corbyn.Senior Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge filed a motion which was seconded by Ann Coffey - but Corbyn has refused to stand down.It's right that David Cameron has gone. Not a bad man just on the wrong side of the argument.Jubilant Nigel Farage has been celebrating Britain's Independence Day as he plots to make June 23 a Bank Holiday.The Ukip leader delivered his post EU referendum result speech in London this morning.He said: "The EU is failing, the EU is dying and I hope we've knocked the first brick out of the wall."I hope this is the first step towards a Europe of sovereign nation states; trading together, neighbours together, friends together - but without flags, anthems or useless old unelected presidents."We pay for your stories!

Economic ‘experts’ warning about negative effects of a Brexit are like the Nazis who ran a smear campaign against Albert Einstein, says Michael Gove2016-6-22ECONOMIC experts warning about the effects of Brexit have been compared to the Nazis who orchestrated a smear campaign against Albert Einstein in the 1930s by Michael Gove.The Brexit-backing Tory said experts cannot always be trusted by pointing to the German scientists who denounced the famous physicist to back up his point.The Justice Secretary told LBC: "I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and to ask if these arguments are good."We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his theories were denounced, and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was because he was Jewish."They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said: 'Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.'"Mr Gove, who co-chairs the Vote Leave campaign, added: "The truth is that if you look at the quality of the analysis, if you look at the facts on the ground, you can come to an appropriate conclusion."And the appropriate conclusion, I think, all of us can come to is that with growth rates so low in Europe, with so many unemployed and with the nature of the single currency so damaging, freeing ourselves from that project can only strengthen our economy."He made his comments after being challenged over why he is not heeding the advice of many economists who have warned that Brexit could have dire consequences and tip the economy into recession.The International Monetary Fund, ten Nobel-prize winning economists and the Bank of England have all warned that leaving the EU could damage the economy.The minister said he will “reflect” on whether to stay in the Cabinet after a Remain vote after warning Britain cannot get net migration below 100,000 a year while still inside the EU.Asked on the Today programme whether he would quit the government, Mr Gove said: “I will do exactly as the Prime Minister asks me.”Pushed again, he added: “I want people to concentrate not on my job but on their jobs. Of course, depending on what the result is on Friday, I will reflect and I will decide what is the best course for me.”

Corbyn facing Labour coup Up to 200 MPs could move to get rid of their leader after Brexit vote2016-6-24JEREMY Corbyn faces a Labour coup as up to 200 MPs launch a plot to oust him as leader as he claims: "I'm staying."As Brits voted for a Brexit, Dame Margaret Hodge told how Corbyn failed the leadership test with an "abysmal" performance during the EU referendum campaign.The Labour leader faces building pressure to quit as Brussels unleashes a backlash against David Cameron's slow-motion EU exit plan.Pro-Leave Labour MP and former minister Frank Field was the latest senior figure to break ranks and pour public scorn on Mr Corbyn's leadership abilities.Northern Labour MPs Angela Smith, Helen Goodman and Caroline Flint were also among those turning their back on Corbyn.Flint said he was not reaching the areas and the people, Labour depend on to win a general election.Former PM Tony Blair called Mr Corbyn’s contribution to Remain  pretty lukewarm and Lord Mandelson said the leader “can’t cut it”.Shockwaves from the UK's decision to vote to leave the European Union were felt across the world, as finances were hit in the aftermath.EU leaders hardened their stance to force Britain out of the union as fast as possible, while the White House insisted President Barack Obama stood by his controversial warning that London would be at the back of the queue for any trade deals.Westminster speculation that Mr Corbyn could use a speech on the aftermath of the referendum to announce his resignation was denied by Labour, despite many of the party's pro-Remain MPs expressing despair at what they see as his lacklustre performance in the campaign, ahead of a no confidence vote against him next week.Mr Field said told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "He clearly isn't the right person to actually lead the party into an election because nobody thinks he will actually win. We clearly need somebody who the public think of as an alternative prime minister."But last night Mr Corbyn insisted he wants to be PM and would stay leader. He said: “I’m carrying on. I’m making the case for unity.”.When asked this morning by ITV News whether he would be staying on, he said: "Absolutely I'm staying."He urged Dame Margaret to “think for a moment” before pressing on with her no confidence motion.He said he was elected with a “very large mandate . . . from the party members as a whole”.In a bid to shore up his leadership, Mr Corbyn will today deliver a speech on immigration. He has pulled out of a planned appearance at Glastonbury.Dan Jarvis, Keir Starmer and Chuka Umunna have all been talked up as Labour moderates who could challenge for leadership.When asked this morning by ITV News whether he would be staying on, he said: "Absolutely I'm staying."Scotland's SNP government was also launching a diplomatic offensive on the continent to remind EU chiefs that Scots voted overwhelmingly to stay in the bloc.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear she intends to use the referendum results to try to force a second independence vote when the negotiating situation becomes clearer.But eyes were all on the Prime Minister after he announced plans to quit his post by October.Tory Remain backers were getting behind Home Secretary Theresa May as the best placed candidate for a leadership battle with ex-London mayor Boris Johnson.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker insisted Britain's break from the EU was "not an amicable divorce", before adding sharply that it was never "a tight love affair anyway"."Britons decided that they want to leave the European Union, so it doesn't make any sense to wait until October to try to negotiate the terms of their departure - I would like to get started immediately," he said.The comments came as a prominent Leave advocate, Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, came under fire for saying a post-Brexit Britain could still join the single market with its free movement of labour rules.Mr Hannan claimed this was not a backtrack on campaign promises as he insisted the Leave side had promised to control immigration, not end it.However, Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke warned against a lurch to right-wing nationalism in the party as he attacked Ukip immigration policies.Britain's new status in the departure lounge of the EU was underlined by the exclusion of Mr Cameron from a meeting of the other 27 leaders next Wednesday to discuss the implications of Brexit.Under the Lisbon Treaty, London has the right to decide when it triggers Article 50, which begins the two-year exit negotiation period.The motion is discussed by Labour MPs at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP).The chair of the PLP can decide whether the motion should be debated.If he allows the vote there will be a secret ballot.The motion has no formal power to force a leader to resign but it would increase pressure on them to do so.If a leader refused to resign, 20% of the unhappy MPs could nominate a willing candidate to stand against the leader.If this threshold is reached, the party's National Executive Committee would decide the timetable for the contest .A spokesman for Mr Corbyn condemned the motion as a "self-indulgent act", although he acknowledged it had been discussed at a post-referendum meeting of the shadow cabinet.He said: "It is a time when our party should be uniting to deal with the real issues that face Britain and the real issues that face the people of Britain, and so to create divisions in the party is a bit of a self-indulgent act."We pay for your stories!

French air traffic control strikes stop Brits getting home to vote on Brexit – so Ryanair offers them vouchers to get a free Burger King meal2016-6-23HUNDREDS of Brits face being unable to vote in today's historic EU referendum after flights were cancelled leaving them stranded across Europe because of French air traffic control strikes.People as far flung as France and Spain are unable to return home to vote on Brexit today due to the strikes - the 10th day of action in the last three months - which forced major airlines to cancel hundreds of flights.Some Brits stuck in Valencia were offered some compensation though for their loss - with Ryanair texting them vouchers for five Euros off a meal at the airport's Burger King branch.Student Luc Hinson was due to leave the Spanish city and return back to London Stansted this morning but says his flight has been delayed by more than two hours and the delay keeps getting longer.The 21-year-old from Wendover Buckinghamshire, who has spent the last year in Valencia on the Erasmus student exchange programme, told The Sun: "We weren't told about the delay until five minutes before boarding was due to start. At the moment it's delayed by two hours and 17 minutes but that keeps increasing."I chose to fly back on this date so I could have my vote in my own hands without having to proxy or postal vote."It's important to me because it's the about the future of the country, a real chance for the country to give a democratic seal of approval to the EU."Luc claims that stranded passengers were texted a code for money off a Burger King meal as compensation for the chaos which has affected flights across Europe.Fellow student Emma Combes, who is due to start at the University of Bath in September, says she can't get back to the UK until Saturday after her easyJet flight from Madrid to Luton on Thursday afternoon was cancelled.Emma claims the earliest flight she could get back free of charge wasn't until Monday so she has had to fork out an extra 190 Euros to get back on Saturday.Emma, 18, from Bedford, who has been out in Spain on holiday with friends, told The Sun: "I was supposed to be flying home from Madrid to London Luton this afternoon, arriving back in enough time to vote this evening."I was informed yesterday that my flight has been cancelled due to the French air strikes meaning our plane is stuck in France."Now I am unable to get home until Saturday, and it is too late to register for a proxy vote."The student says she is gutted because she wasn't old enough to vote in last year's general election and was "looking forward to being able to have [her] say this time".Dozens of other travellers have taken to social media to voice their disgust at the cancellations and delays - many furious that they've been robbed of their right to vote by the strikes.Dan Gourd posted on Twitter: "@David_Cameron @easyJet my easyJet flight from Marseille to Gatwick 2moro is cancelled so I cant vote on the EU referendum!! What can I do??"Joel McConnell wrote: "I'm stuck in France can't get home to vote, flight cancelled cuz of air strikes."Lesley B added: "My flight is cancelled & Wont be back for 10. I'm being told this isn't valid reason for a proxy vote. Doesn't sound right!! Anyone know?" While Sarah Chivers asked: "@easyJet my flight home to the UK has been cancelled. What happens to my right to vote?"One user, Conor Murphy, even asked if there was anyone who wasn't planning to vote before could go out and vote Remain for him.Meanwhile Melville Pereira tweeted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: "@jeremycorbyn my flight back to UK has been cancelled cos our friends the French need a day off. How can I vote so we can still be friends?"Some even commented on the irony that Ryanair was backing Vote Remain but due to cancellations by the airline they couldn't get back to vote at all.Dianne Delahunty said: "@Ryanair sent me mail urging me to #VoteRemain - exactly what I wld have done except they cancelled my flight home so I can't vote at all."In France footie fans are also stuck as they try to get home from seeing their teams play at Euro 2016.Sunil Suri, who was due to fly back to Gatwick from a work conference in Barcelona this afternoon, is stuck in Spain after his flight was delayed.The 25-year-old from London says he "deliberately picked an early flight" so he could make it back in time for the vote - even though he plans to head to Lyon tomorrow for Euro 2016.Ryanair has yet to comment on the delays at Valencia - or the offer of the Burger King voucher - butthe Dublin-based airline's chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: "These strikes by French ATC workers are becoming a weekly event by now, causing chaos for families wanting to take their summer breaks but also designed to upset the plans of football fans coming from far and wide to France to enjoy the Euros."It is simply unacceptable that this situation is allowed to persist, and we regret that once again we have been forced to cancel a number of flights due to the selfish actions of these workers."We pay for your stories!

Jo Cox’s husband pays emotional tribute as thousands join him and his kids on what would have been murdered MP’s 42nd birthday2016-6-22MURDERED Jo Cox’s widower Brendan led emotional tributes to her as events took place around the world to celebrate her life on what would have been her 42nd birthday.Speaking in front of thousands of people in Trafalgar Square Mr Cox told the crowd he had come to say how much the love and support of well-wishers meant to him.And he said he wanted his two children Cuillin and Lejla how well loved their mother was.He said: “She just wanted people to be happy and for the world to be a fairer place, that’s where her politics came from.“When she saw pain she wanted to do all she could to alleviate it.“Jo lived her life to the full, with a pedal to the floor with missing brake pads.“She was a mountain climber, a runner, a cyclist, an avid reader, an awful cook, a swimmer, a great exaggerator, a wild food forager, a middle lane driver, a ball of energy and determination, and above all else she was a mum.“She was the best mum that any child could wish for and wish we do, to have her back in our lives.“Since Thursday Cuillin, Lejla and I have spoken every day about the things we will miss, the memories we will cherish.“We try to remember not how cruelly she has been taken from us but how unbelievably lucky we were to have her in our lives for so long.”Organisers said the events, being held in a variety of locations, are a tribute to Mrs Cox's "love, energy, passion, flair, Yorkshire heritage and belief in the humanity of every person in every place".The band that played at the couple's wedding, Diddley Dee, performed and a group of the MP's friends formed an honour guard dressed in suffragette-style sashes.Leaders of multiple faiths laid some 42 white roses, the symbol of Yorkshire, to mark her birthday at the event, hosted by Mrs Cox's friend, Mariella Frostrup.Giving speeches in memory of the murdered MP were the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and actors Gillian Anderson and Bill Nighy.Her life was also commemorated at the Glastonbury Festival this afternoon.Revellers stopped and held an impromptu two minute silence to pay their respects to the murdered Labour politician. To get to the event in Trafalgar Square Mr Cox and his children led a flotilla of houseboats from the community where they live.And to commemorate the Yorkshire MP, a boat called the Yorkshire Rose was filled with flowers in memory of her and towed along as part of the flotilla.  The family of Jo Cox made an emotional journey along the Thames, towing a boat full of flowers in her memoryHolding his dad's hand Cuillin Cox makes his way to the service to celebrate his mother, the murdered MP Jo Cox who would have been 42 todayA fund created in Cox's memory by her friends and family has raised more than £1.25million for charities close to her heart, following more than 37,500 individual donations.Mrs Cox was shot and stabbed in the street last Thursday in her Batley and Spen constituency in West Yorkshire, where there will also be a commemoration with her sister Kim Leadbeater.The murder of Mrs Cox, who was campaigning for Britain to stay in the European Union and was a major advocate for refugee rights, shook the EU referendum campaign and sent shock waves around the world.The commemorations began less than 18 hours before the polls open in Britain's closely-contested referendum on whether it should stay in the EU or leave.Widower Brendan Cox, in his first interview since his wife's murder, said he thought she was murdered due to her political beliefs."She was a politician and she had very strong political views and I believe she was killed because of those views," he told BBC television."I think she died because of them, and she would want to stand up for those in death as much as she did in life."He also said she had "worried" about the tone of the EU referendum debate -- "the tone of whipping up fears and whipping up hatred potentially".Hers was the first murder of a British politician since 1990 when Ian Gow was assassinated by Irish Republican Army paramilitaries.Thomas Mair, 52, has been charged with Cox's murder.On his first appearance in court on Saturday, he gave his name as "Death to traitors, freedom for Britain".A psychiatric report was requested.

‘I’m now even more confused!’ Katie Price takes part in live EU debate even though she’s never voted in her life2016-6-22KATIE Price has revealed that she is even more confused about which way to vote tomorrow - even though she’s never voted in her life.The former glamour model was in the audience for tonight’s EU Referendum debate on Channel 4 and admitted she still hadn’t made up her mind.Looking smart in a pink blazer and jeans with her hair pulled back, she listened to the views from both the Leave and Remain camps.But when host Jeremy Paxman went over to get her opinion, she said she felt even more confused than before she arrived.The 38-year-old mum-of-five said: “Believe it or not, I came here confused and I’m now even more confused.“I’ve never voted before and I feel I’m pressured I have to vote this time. Lots of my friends are in, some are out and I’m asking them questions.“My son’s got disabilities, so in my case I’m thinking what would be the best for his future, for the NHS, if he goes on holiday and he gets hurt there or something.“There’s all of this. Do I think of myself and my family, or do I think about the country? I am just confused.”Katie has never voted in an election in her life, but in the general election of 2001, she stood for parliament with the slogan “For a bigger and betta future”.Price, who was 23 at the time, stood as an independent in the constituency of Stretford and Urmston in Greater Manchester.Her main manifesto pledge was free plastic surgery for all but she also promised free package holidays on the NHS and tax cuts to people who had affairs with foreign footballers.She said at the time:  "My policies are to make things fun. The election is boring. I'm here to spice things up."Ever the optimist, she told the BBC: "I know it will take a big swing to win the seat but there's no bigger swinger than me."She even placed a £5 bet on herself to win the seat, getting odds of 150-1 but she only received 713 and was beaten by Labour's Beverley Hughes.Got a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220

Boris Johnson gives his vision of post-Brexit Britain in rallying cry for independence2016-6-19BULLISH Boris Johnson last night outlined his vision of a post-Brexit Britain and declared: “This is our moment.”The Tory MP said people have nothing to fear by “backing ourselves” and voting to leave the EU on Thursday.And he revealed the immediate steps he would take to break the nation free from the shackles he says have held us back for 40 years.In a rallying call, he said: “This is it now. Let’s do this thing.“Later this week we’ll have a once in a lifetime opportunity. This is our moment when the British people take centre stage in history.“The eyes of Europe will be on us and hundreds of millions of people will be praying that we do the right thing and vote for change.This is our moment when the British people take centre stage“If we do this, we’ll be speaking up for democracy not only in Britain but throughout Europe and it will be a fine thing that will echo through the ages.”Mr Johnson said several of the worst EU ties could be broken off within days — even before talks about full withdrawal have started.His first action would be to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, putting full rule of law back into the hands of our own judges.Next he would make preparations for the return of our annual contributions, leaving millions of pounds more for British ministers to spend.Seizing back control of our borders would be the third major act, with a points-based immigration system devised that would be fair to people from across the world.But BoJo insisted the first and most crucial act in the hours after Brexit is to make clear and cogent statements about Britain’s new place in Europe.The most important thing first of all is that David Cameron should stay on as Prime MinisterThe former London Mayor said: “The most important thing first of all is that David Cameron should stay on as Prime Minister — and I am sure he will.“He will need to send a very powerful message to our European friends and partners that this is not a vote against Europe. It will be a vote against the institutions of the European Union.“Britain must send a powerful signal that we remain committed to partnership and friendship with our friends and partners and that should be done very soon.”Steps towards full divorce from the EU could be taken “fairly rapidly”, he added, without starting the full exit process by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.Mr Johnson gave a glimpse of the changes ahead as he launched into the last lap of the referendum campaign, following a three-day suspension due to the killing of MP Jo Cox.He will criss-cross the country in a helicopter to get across his message to undecided voters.This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take back control of our democracy from an unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable and unreformed European UnionOn polling day, he will be in Scotland attending his daughter Lara’s graduation ceremony before returning to London. In an exclusive interview with The Sun on Sunday, he said: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take back control of our democracy from an unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable and unreformed European Union.“We are working flat out to achieve this. It’s a chance to take back control of huge sums of money and to take back control of our trade policy. There’s a massive opportunity for Britain. We should be full of excitement and hope about what can be achieved.“This country has never gone wrong by believing in itself and trusting in its democratic institutions.“That is what is at stake. This week is about whether we believe in British democracy or are content to see it steadily eroded and lost to unaccountable, unelected people overseas.”Mr Johnson insisted the Tory party — and the country — can pull back together again once the matter has been settled.Though insisting Mr Cameron should stay as PM, he warned him against axing fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove from the Cabinet. “David has my full confidence,” he stressed. “Don’t forget I was one of the first people to back him for the leadership in 2005.This week is about whether we believe in British democracy or are content to see it steadily eroded and lost to unaccountable, unelected people overseas“He was the best person for the job then and he is now. I think he will survive, whatever the outcome. There are a lot of people signing letters saying they want him to stay on — and Michael Gove as well.“In these campaigns, you always expect things to get energetic from time to time. But people need to get back together again and continue a one-nation Conservative agenda.”Mr Johnson, who is expected to get a Cabinet post in the next reshuffle, said his own future was irrelevant.He also defended the heavy focus on immigration by the Leave campaign and blamed free movement partly for the rise of extremism.He said: “As you know, I’m pro-immigration. I’m the proud descendant of Turks. My family is like a genetic version of a UN peace-keeping force.“We come from everywhere, but I believe passionately that people should become British and also that you should have a policy that is fair and balanced.There is nothing to be afraid of. There will be no giant earthquake on Friday morning“The other reason for taking back control is that I don’t like extremism. I don’t like the far-Right parties that you see coming up across Europe.“I am a very moderate liberal Conservative but I think that the problem with immigration is that politicians have promised they can control it when legally they can’t because we are in the EU. You can only spike the guns of the extremists and the people who are genuinely anti-immigrant if you take back control.”He added: “There is nothing to be afraid of. There will be no giant earthquake on Friday morning.“The only economic outcome you will see is that people on low wages will gradually get a pay rise.“Sun on Sunday readers won’t go wrong believing in Britain, as I know they do. The fundamental question is, do we trust ourselves to govern ourselves or do we want to be increasingly run by people we don’t elect?“This is a great opportunity and it would be a shame if we missed it. That’s why I will be out there this week telling everybody the same message: ‘We can do it. Let’s do it’.”

David Cameron pleads with voters to choose Remain so UK can reshape EU2016-6-20DAVID Cameron today calls on wavering voters to give him a powerful mandate to reshape the EU for the better by voting to stay in it on Thursday.A referendum victory would put Britain in a “very enhanced position” to “drive forward changes”, the PM insisted.And top of his list will be a tougher clamp down on freedom of movement, Mr Cameron said, declaring: “We want as much as we can achieve with that.”The PM issued the pledge during an interview with The Sun yesterday - one of his last before the landmark poll in just 48 hours time.Quizzed on whether he agreed with Theresa May’s call for “further reform” to tighten immigration rules, he vowed to use the UK’s rotating six-month presidency of the EU next year to push through his agenda. Mr Cameron said: “If we stay in, that is not the end of reform.“Britain will be in a very enhanced position.“There is no doubt that a British Prime Minister with a mandate from the election, a re-negotiation, and a referendum would have the ability in Europe to drive forward changes that are needed.”DAVID Cameron has lashed out at Michael Gove’s attack on experts to accuse him of “Donald Trump-style” politics.Ramping his assault on Leave campaign bosses, the PM also accused them of “selling a fantasy” to voters and vowed to “call that out”.The PM’s broadside is his most stinging yet on his fellow senior Tories and will only deepen the party’s bitter civil war.Pro-Brexit Justice Secretary Mr Gove last month dismissed warnings from “establishment” economists such as the Bank of England against leaving the EU by saying:“People in this country have had enough of experts”.Hitting back in his interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said: “The idea we should not listen to experts I think is very worrying for our future politics.“If we are going into a ‘let’s not listen to anyone who knows what they are talking about’, it is just sort of Donald Trump-style, it is all going to be great.“I worry.”The PM also insisted it would be a “tragedy” for Britain to walk away from Brussels because “people have been told things which are simply not true”.He highlighted what he dubbed “three untruths” on most of Vote leave’s leaflets – narrowly stopping short of accusing Mr Gove and Boris Johnson of telling outright lies.And he accused the Leave campaign of having “morphed into the UKIP campaign”.Mr Cameron said: “All they are talking about is unless you leave, Turkey is going to join. Not true.“They are being told unless you leave £350m a week is going to go to Brussels. Not true.“They are being told we are going to be part of a European army. Not true.“And they are endlessly talking about migration, often in a way that is designed to frighten, scare and divide people. And that is all that they are left with.”On immigration, modest victories in Brussels to keep out criminals, sham marriage holders and benefits scroungers is far from  the end of his ambitions, Mr Cameron insisted, but part of “an on-going process”.He added: “We have got to deliver all the things that we said, plus I hope more.“We are re-opening the free movement directive. We want as much as we can achieve with that - the more you can do the better.“We have got the UK presidency coming up, we should be leading this organisation not leaving it.”But he warned: “All of these things are on the agenda if we stay, and they are all gone forever if we leave.”The fresh reform pledges are the first insight the Premier has offered into his post-referendum victory plan to pacify millions of Brits who will vote for Brexit.A THIRD of all Brits are still not totally convinced how to vote in the knife-edge EU referendum with just 48 hours to go, a massive survey has found.The online voter advice test by tech firm Crowdpac has also revealed the race is still almost tied, with 50% currently backing Leave and 49% for Remain.A huge total of 567,998 people underwent the sophisticated test, devised by former No10 strategy chief Steve Hilton.Once their responses were weighted for national balance, a total of 68% were found to have a firm view on how to vote.But even at this late stage, 31% said they found arguments on both sides persuasive – meaning there could still be all to play for.The huge number of respondents also allowed Crowdpac to produce detailed regional breakdowns of voting intentions on Thursday.Scotland and London are the country’s two areas that will overwhelmingly vote to stay in, and the North, the East and the Midlands will definitely vote to get out.But the South East, the South West and Wales are split almost down the middle.In a boost to the Leave campaign, the Crowdpac survey also found Brexit has a slight lead overall on the economic arguments – which Remain bosses consider their strongest point.Instead, the In campaign has a lead on questions of society and identity.Crowdpac CEO Steve Hilton said: “This is the biggest ever survey of British voters and it shows it’s all to play for as the referendum campaigns move into the crucial final phase.“The Crowdpac survey is not like normal polls — the result comes after voters have completed a questionnaire with all the main arguments presented objectively.”He also highlighted fighting terrorism, slashing red tape and signing more trade deals with the rest of the world as his other EU reform priorities.The fresh wave of reforms come on top of a series of successes in recent years with the EU that have got “almost no attention”, the PM insisted.They include re-writing EU law to enforce the removal of 6,000 EU citizens from the UK for free movement abuses, such sleeping rough and not working.But the promise of more reform also risks backfiring.Leave campaigners leapt on the PM’s vow last night to insist  it highlights his failure to win meaningful concessions to curtail free movement in his renegotiation for a new deal just four months ago.Vote Leave  Chief Executive Matthew Elliott branded the PM’s promisies “an admission of failure”, adding: “He tried to get reform but failed spectacularly.“No one will believe his claim now that an IN vote would somehow unlock more reforms later down the track.If we vote to stay in the EU politicians will laugh in our face if we ask for more.”Mr Cameron will spend the final 48 hours of the referendum fight ramping up the risks of leaving the EU in a bid to sway up to five million still undecided voters away from backing Brexit.Speaking on a train to a campaign visit in Birmingham yesterday, he also tried to highlight the security risks of Brexit.Leaving the EU would “divide the West and divide democracies” against threats such as ISIS or Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Mr Cameron claimed.BREXIT could slap an extra £200 a year on drivers’ fuel pump bills, David Cameron last night claimed.The PM told The Sun that leaving the EU will spark a sharp drop in the value of the Pound by as much as 20 per cent.That will ramp the cost to garage owners of importing petrol and diesel, which they will pass on to consumers, and Sun readers will suffer the most.Mr Cameron claimed: “It could put £200 on a typical fuel bill for the year for someone driving a Ford Focus.“If the pound goes down, the cost of petrol goes up.”In a bid to flag up the risks of Brexit to ordinary people’s pockets, the PM added: “My worry is that the people who will be hit the hardest by leaving the EU are hardworking Sun readers, who want to support their families.“That is just one aspect of where people who not necessarily on high wages are the most at risk of an exit where we see the economy shrink, opportunities go down and we lose jobs.”Last month, Leave campaign boss Boris Johnson insisted Brexit would have the opposite effect on fuel prices by liberating.Breaking free from Brussels would the end EU’s “stranglehold” on our pumps by letting the British government slash VAT on fuel below the current 15 per cent floor set by Brussels.But the PM hit back at the ex-Tory London Mayor’s promise to brand it “fantasy” economics”.And he named ex-MI6 chief Sir John Sawyers and former MI5 boss Lord Evans as “the two people who have influenced me on this more than anybody else”, adding: “They are in no doubt that the cooperation we have, the work we do together is incredibly important”.Despite the bitter Tory civil war that he and George Osborne have ignited with “Project Fear” scare claims, the PM insisted he regrets nothing about his explosive campaign.Instead, he vowed to press on with his dire warnings right up until Thursday.Mr Cameron said: “I have said the things that I want to say, about the strength of our economy, the strength of our country, the safety that we get in numbers at a time of difficulty.“And I am just going to go on saying them, and that is that.”Challenged on why he had failed to reassure voters so far on the tinderbox issue of immigration, Mr Cameron admitted it was “a very difficult challenge in a modern economy and in a globalised world”.There were no simple solutions to halt the massive influx of new arrivals that has reduced his target to tatters, the PM also claimed, saying that “simple can sometimes be simplistic”.The PM’s plea to voters came as one of the EU’s two chiefs yesterday admitted the UK’s referendum was “a warning signal” and Europe must now change.DAVID Cameron knew his target to cut immigration to “tens of thousands” was impossible for four years but continued to make the pledge, one of his closest former aides claimed last night.Steve Hilton – who attended top-level meetings with the Prime Minister – said civil servants directly warned the PM he was on mission impossible because EU rules insist on the free movement of people.But despite being told in 2012 it was a no-go, he said Mr Cameron repeated the promise – even including it in his general election manifesto last year.In an interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Hilton said: “We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it.”Just weeks ago the PM insisted he stuck by his “ambition” of bringing net migration into the UK – which last month hit 333,000.Mr Hilton added: “You don’t need to sit in a ‘stock take’ meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we’re in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it.“In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable.“When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave.“For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what (Michael) Gove and (Boris) Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics.”EU Council President Donald Tusk said: “Whatever the UK vote is, we must take long hard look on the future of the Union.“It would be foolish to ignore such a warning signal.“There are more signals of dissatisfaction with the Union from all over Europe, not just the UK.”Issuing his own plea to British voters, former Polish PM Mr Tusk added: “I appeal to the British citizens: stay with us, we need you.“Together we will cope with future challenges, apart it will be more difficult.”Mr Tusk also said his feelings are shared by “almost all Europeans and European Leaders”.Backing him up, EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker added his own plea for a Remain vote, saying the union would have “a missing element” without Britain’s pragmatism and no-nonsense approach.Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Man charged with killing Jo Cox said in court his name is ‘death to traitors, freedom for Britain’2016-6-18THE man charged with murdering Labour MP Jo Cox gave his name as "death to traitors, freedom for Britain" when he appeared in court this morning.Tommy Mair, 52, appeared in court shortly after 10am today over the killing of the mum-of-two in Birstall, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, on Thursday.Mair, wearing a grey prison issue tracksuit and with a bald head and beard, spoke to state his name.When asked his name he responded: "death to traitors, freedom for Britain".Dressed in a police-issue grey sweat shirt and tracksuit bottoms, balding Mair appeared jaded but stood as Deputy Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot entered.After his handcuffs were removed, Mair was asked by the court clerk to stand and then for his name.The defendant looked towards the bench and said softly: “My name is Death To Traitors, Freedom For Britain.”Puzzled Judge Arbuthnot, deputy chief magistrate for England and Wales, replied: “Pardon, sorry?”Mair then repeated the name. After a long pause, the clerk then asked for his date of birth and home address.When also asked for his address and date of birth Mair said nothing.His lawyers confirmed his name was Thomas Mair afterwards.West Yorkshire Police arrested Mair, 52, on Thursday and he was last night charged with murder.He appeared behind reinforced glass at Westminster Magistrates' Court this morning charged with the murder of Jo Cox, with possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon - a knife.He is also charged with causing grievous bodily harm to Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, who was also allegedly attacked at the same time by Mair.He was remanded in custody to appear at London's Old Bailey on Monday.He was handcuffed to a guard in the dock during the hearing and will be held at Belmarsh Prison.Mrs Cox's final words were "my pain is too much" as she lay dying in the street.Further shocking details have emerged of Mrs Cox’s shooting and stabbing as she arrived at her Batley and Spen constituency surgery in West Yorkshire on Thursday.Witnesses said that Mair yelled, “Keep Britain independent” and “This is for Britain” during his frenzied attack.And the full bravery of retired miner Bernard Carter-Kenny, 77, has been revealed for the first time.He was stabbed in the abdomen as he tried to save mum-of-two Mrs Cox from her killer.The Labour MP was said to have attended a school and a care home before going to Birstall library at around 12.45pm for her surgery.Mr Kenny had pulled his car up at the same time and his wife got out to go to the library.As she was doing so, Mr Kenny then saw Mrs Cox get out of her car and be attacked by a man carrying a knife.A witness said Mr Kenny then tried to help the MP, but was stabbed in the stomach as he tried to intervene and then went into a shop to get help.He was yesterday recovering from his injuries in hospital in Leeds with his wife Doreen and two sons at his bedside.At the scene, the attacker carried on stabbing Mrs Cox, causing her to fall to the ground. He was then seen taking a gun from his black bag and shooting her three times.Witnesses said Mair had shouted, “Britain first, keep Britain independent, Britain always comes first, this is for Britain”.Mrs Cox was pronounced dead at 1.48pm. A post-mortem recorded that she died from multiple stab and gunshot wounds.Yesterday it emerged that two unarmed police officers found the suspect in a nearby cul-de-sac.Witnesses said the cops shouted at him to drop the bag and he then stood still with his arms outstretched. He was heard to say, “It’s me,” as he as the officers approached and handcuffed him.Mair was also said to have told cops he was a “political activist” after his arrest. He was carrying ammunition, a modified .22 rifle with sawn-off barrel and a knife.Police later found extremist material at his home.Mair will spend his first few nights in Belmarsh Prison on suicide watch and under almost constant lockdown during the day.His cell will be stripped down so nothing can be torn apart to attack himself or others.He will also be issued with special clothes that cannot be torn into strips to make a noose.A large group of Muslim prisoners charged and convicted of jihadist terrorist offences are held at the jail. Prison governors will be alert to the risk of Mair being attacked.Mair will have access to the 18-inmate SSU’s separate exercise yard. Staff have even set up apple trees and a selection of planters so inmates can grow veg.A source said: “It is a secure yard away from the main body of the prison so the inmates in the high security unit can exercise alone. To all intents and purposes it is a prison within a prison. The trees and the planters have proved a great success in giving those held long-term on the wing a bit of purpose in their life.“But they are not allowed access to any tools like pruners or shears and are heavily supervised on a more than one-to-one basis.“Mair will be assessed for a few days to make sure he is not at risk of doing himself harm.“The officers will treat him with professionalism and the degree of care that he is entitled to.“But that does not go for the rest of the prison population and that is why Mair will be kept in the secure unit.”Mum-of-two Jo, 41, was shot three times and knifed just before 1pmShe was elected to Parliament in May 2015.Floral tributes have been laid at the scene of her death while hundreds of people attended a candle-lit vigil in Parliament Square, central London.On Friday afternoon PM David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited Jo Cox's constituency and called for tolerance as they announced Parliament will be recalled on Monday following her horrific murder.The PM and the Labour leader said "our nation is in shock" as they made an unprecedented joint statement to call for unity, close to the spot where the mum of two was killed.Joined by Commons Speaker John Bercow, the pair leader paid their respects to the fallen MP and laid flowers in Birstall, West Yorkshire yesterday.Mr Corbyn said he had asked the Prime Minister to recall MPs to Parliament on Monday to pay tribute to their 41-year-old colleague, and that this had been agreed.The House of Commons is currently not sitting due to the EU referendum on June 23.Mr Cameron said: "Two children have lost their mother and a husband has lost his loving wife."Parliament has lost one of its most passionate campaigners and the nation is shocked."Today our nation is rightly shocked."And I think it is a moment to stand back and think about some of the things that are so important about our country."US President Barack Obama on Friday phoned Cox's husband Brendan to offer condolences."The president noted that the world is a better place because of her selfless service to others, and that there can be no justification for this heinous crime," the White House said in a statement.We pay for your stories!

Conservative think-tank puts pressure on David Cameron to call ‘attachment’ to notion of free movement into question2016-6-18A TORY think tank backed by senior Ministers heaped pressure on David Cameron last night by joining calls to review “antiquated” EU immigration rules.Bright Blue said Brussels lawmakers had to “face reality” and revise free movement legislation which allows all EU nationals to come to the UK to live and work as they please.And it said the EU’s “stubborn attachment” to the principle was shattering public support.The think tank is a “modernising” group which counts Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and former Trade Minister Francis Maude on its advisory board.Bright Blue director Ryan Shorthouse said: “My personal view is that we should remain in the EU.“But a considerable proportion of the population will have voted to leave in the EU referendum, largely because of the inability to control the number of people migrating to our country.“The EU must face reality and learn the lessons of this flirtation with Brexit: the free movement of people is unsustainable in a growing bloc which contains countries with such diverse living standards.”He added: “There needs to be a meaningful review and revision of this antiquated principle to lessen the huge flow of people across Europe, a phenomenon which is unfair to both richer and poorer member states.”The intervention comes just three days after Theresa May revealed the first cracks in the Government’s stance on immigration policy.The Home Secretary said “we should look at further reform in the future” just hours after Chancellor George Osborne dismissed the suggestion out of hand.The split came 24 hours after Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson plunged his party into chaos by making a shock call for curbs to Brussels’ free movement laws – which give all EU nationals to live and work in Britain.Downing Street was forced on Tuesday night dismiss claims it may offer controls on free movement in a last-ditch bid to win over voters in next week’s Referendum.Official figures in May showed net migration hit a whopping 333,000 last year – with net migration from EU countries at 184,000.We pay for your stories!

We speak to nation’s grafters on Brexit frontline before referendum of a lifetime2016-6-22TOMORROW Britain goes to the polls to vote in the referendum of a lifetime.As the country decides whether we should stay or leave the EU, The Sun visited four regions to find out the issues that matter to the country’s grafters.And from beleaguered fishermen in Grimsby to overstretched NHS workers in Romford, East London, and young mums in Lincolnshire, voters on the front line are pleading: “We want our country back.”WORRIES over British sovereignty, national pride and our inability to deport dangerous criminals are on the mind of Anne Port.Anne, 77, of Romford, East London, said: “Before we went into the EU we were a prosperous country and we made our own decisions.“We were the envy of the world but now we’re a laughing stock. The change is radical and it’s going too fast. We can’t even deport criminals.“There are some people coming here and ripping the heart out of my country. I’ve heard Romanians say they will rob and cheat people if they don’t get benefits.“I want my grandchildren to be able to go to university, get a job, and a home they can afford. I can see a better future ahead if we leave.”EU quotas led to the decline of the British fishing industry and only a Brexit can now save it, warns Darren Kenyon.The fisherman, 48, from Grimsby, said: “If we don’t leave, fishing here will die and hundreds of years of history will die with it. There were trawlers stem to stem when I came down to the docks as a boy.The whole place was bustling. Now it’s a wasteland.“EU quotas were the death of this industry. We can’t fish in our own waters any more and we’re getting by hand-to-mouth. There’s no point fishing for fish any more.”CHEAP labour from the EU led to courier firm boss Angie Cook’s first business folding, she says.Angie, 50, said: “I want out. The migrants were coming in by the truck load. I was priced out of the market and was forced to close.”Angie, from Boston, Lincs, now has a new business. She said: “I have only ever employed British workers.”IMMIGRATION is having a severe knock-on effect on NHS services, says Dan Hutch.Dan, 56 — who works in maintenance at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston — said: “The queues at A&E are abysmal and our NHS is at breaking point.“Many Eastern Europeans sit outside getting phenomenally drunk. We must vote to leave.”THE EU’s power and reach has been over- extended while its accountability has diminished, believes Labour club steward Tony Booth.Tony, 45, who works at the club in Kidsgrove, Stoke-on-Trent, said: “The original idea was good, having a free-trade area. But this superstate has gone too far now and they interfere far too much.“We have no say in how it’s run. People over there we’ve never heard of are making all the rules, and constantly dictating to us. I want to take back control of our laws again.“This European state has become too big.”OLDER generations who remember life before the Common Market have convinced Natalie Whone that the young are being hoodwinked.The 33-year-old support worker for the elderly, from Stoke-on-Trent, said: “They’ve told me what life was like before the EU and think we should go back to how it was. We should be able to deal with our issues ourselves. We need to stand on our own two feet.“We are part of Europe but we don’t need to be part of the EU.“Many of my friends wanted to stay when the Referendum was announced but they have all changed to out. If you listen to people who remember it, you understand there’s nothing to fear from being out.”YOUTH employment is a major concern for shopping centre cleaner Alan Vickers.Alan, 67, from Romford, said: “My 19-year-old son is struggling to find a job because immigrants keep getting them. We need to look after our own rather than caring for the immigrants who come in and immediately get jobs and benefits.“We have to come out and fight our own corner for a change.“It’s time to start looking after our youngsters and future generations of British people.”MIGRANT Sylvia Szal believes some people coming to the UK now are not making enough effort to search for jobs and integrate into Britain.Sylvia, 29, moved to Boston, Lincs, from Poland ten years ago to find work.She said: “Many of the new wave do not come over to work and integrate but take all the benefits that they can and misbehave.“The country needs to have a system like Australia, where they can choose workers dependent on demand. Surely the UK should be able to choose people that are useful? You should vote out.”HOUSING is a huge worry for Shiraz Younas, who is fighting to get his own home.The 28-year-old, from Romford, revealed to The Sun: “I want to see more housing developments. We are a small country and we have to stop immigrants taking advantage.“Everyone wants to come here to make the most of what is offered. If we are not careful things will get much, much worse.“There isn’t enough housing or schools or hospitals to cope with everybody already.”THE European Union restricts Britain’s global trading strengths, believes small business owner Ian Winchester-Fraser.Ian, 67, has an IT support company with branches in Romford and York. He said: “We could be what Hong Kong is to China. We should be able to trade freely throughout the whole world, with whoever we want. I’d want to trade with China, Russia, India and even North Korea.“We are supposed to be able to influence what goes on within the EU but our influence has been diluted because of the sheer number of countries.”YOUNG mum Molly Turner is worried about the effects that EU immigration will have on the future of her one-year-old daughter Pearl.The 21-year-old said: “You hear all these languages being spoken on the street and the language barrier is a real problem. You just can’t communicate with people over here.”Molly, from Boston, Lincolnshire, added: “I’m worried about what the immigration will mean for Pearl. There seem to be fewer opportunities now for British people as they are being undercut by foreign workers.“I also worry about the effects on school. She won’t get the education I want for her if she’s in a massive class with loads of people.“It’s also impossible to get a GP appointment. It just makes life that little bit harder.”LEAVING the EU will bring problems, says nurse Saras Srirangan — but staying will be far worse.The 59-year-old, of Romford, said: “The NHS would close without immigrants to work in it but we have to control our borders and not be dictated to by Europe. We can decide what’s good for us, not the other way round.”NEWSAGENT assistant Farhan Saleem is sick of not having his own home.The Romford-born dad, 34, said: “I have been waiting for a council property for a year and I have a wife and five kids.“I’ve paid my taxes and always worked. Other communities coming to this country get houses straight away. They aren’t even willing to work and it makes me so angry.”MORE than 40 years in the EU has taken its toll on much of the UK, reckons 69-year-old Trevor Cullum.He believes leaving will stop the decline of his home town of Grimsby, a once-thriving fishing port, and others like it.Trevor said: “I used to be proud to say I was from round here, but now it’s a dump. The EU strangled our main industry, the money went and so did the investment from Westminster.“Like so many other towns, the shops closed down and immigrants were placed here. We don’t have enough resources to cope and it’s not fair on locals. Voting out is our last chance to get our country back.”

MEP Daniel Hannan predicts dire future where ‘there is only decay and crippling poverty’ if we stay in the EU2016-6-23IT is 2026, and the European Federation is continuing on its slow, sulky decline.The combined economies of its 32 states, which amounted to a hefty 31 per cent of the world’s economy as recently as 1980, now make up just eight per cent.The euro has been in more or less constant crisis since 2008, and structural unemployment is a way of life.A generation in southern Europe has known only poverty and emigration.At first, these young people came to find work in Britain and the other northern EU states. But it wasn’t long before the euro crisis began to affect the whole continent.As bailout after bailout was decreed, taxes began to rise across the EU. But no tax was enough to solve the problems of the single currency.The euro staggers on, paid for by Britain, Germany and the Scandinavian states, inflicting ruin and misery on the Mediterranean.The northern countries, including the UK, were forced to find this extra cash at the same time as receiving more settlers. The pressure on their schools, roads and hospitals grew. Life became more crowded, slower, tetchier.We had our chance in June 2016 and blew itAt the same time, Eurocrats were determined to keep their border-free zone intact, however much it encouraged illegal immigration. Millions a year arrived in Spain, Italy, Greece and Poland, intent on going further.Some of our brightest youngsters, by contrast, started leaving to work in countries less ­constrained by regulation.The EU’s hostility to innovation is especially damaging to high-tech industries, such as medical research and software, and companies are relocating from Britain to Asia and North America.The EU’s dislike of shale meant Britain couldn’t exploit the bonanza of cheap fuel under its soil. High energy costs and taxes closed what was left of our energy-intensive industries, such as steel, cement,plastics and ceramics. Unemployment rose further.The EU’s Ports Services Directive, brought in almost immediately after our referendum, hugely increased the costs of our commercial ports. More people lost their jobs.But by then it was too late to do anything. We had had our chance in June 2016 and blew it.It wasn’t long before we realised what we had done. In 2017, the euro crisis hit Italy and then France.Suddenly, the disaster in Greece looked like a sideshow.The EU was determined to keep the currency together, and the bailout fund was inadequate.More money was needed, and it came through the EU budget, including from the states that had kept their currencies — Britain, Sweden and Denmark.By then, no one in Britain was surprised. After the 2016 referendum, we were wearily accustomed to having to go along with whatever Brussels decreed.At first, it was only the small things. The European Commission had held an especially convivial meeting on the morning of June 24 — Jean-Claude Juncker had insisted on champagne, though it was only 9am — to celebrate Britain’s “confirmation of her European commitment”.Angela Merkel gave a delighted speech saying that, despite all the protests and complaints, it was clear most British people favoured deeper integration.After all, she said, the scheme had been clearly laid out before the referendum.The European Commission had publicly stated that it wanted economic, political and military amalgamation.Within days, contentious legislation that had been put in storage before the vote was brought forth — restrictions on financial services, the ban on high-power electrical appliances, the import licensing rules that wiped out parts of London’s art market, the mid-term budget hike.British ministers complained half-heartedly, but as the President of the European Parliament MartinSchulz triumphantly put it: “This is what you voted for. You belong to Europe.”Obsessed with their schemes for political merger, EU leaders were unable to cope with the economic crisis or the massive population flows into Europe, which made unemployment worse and lifted support for extremist parties, some on the fringe Left, some on the fringe Right.What they had in common was a sense of rage. Voters could see they had lost control of the two things that were central to the function of government — money and borders. Europe, the place where democracy had been born, slid into populism and anger.The rest of the world thought it sad, but was too busy making money to really care. As an over-regulated Europe fell ­further behind, Asia and the Americas surged ahead.There are no European states at the G7. It now includes the US, China, Japan, Brazil, India, Canada and Korea (unified since the assassination of Kim Jong-un in 2020).New technologies have transformed life in many developing states. Driverless cars, 3D printing, extraordinary advances in biotech. Only the EU — in hock to lobbies and vested interests, hostile to innovation, protectionist — has been left behind.Even new members are regretting choiceBritons who want to know what life might have been like had they voted Leave ten years ago look wistfully at the other common-law, English-speaking democracies.Countries such as New Zealand and Canada are booming, trading freely with the Asian giants and each other, prospering with managed economic immigration, encouraging innovation and start-ups.Unsurprisingly, there is now significant emigration from Britain to there.Plenty of people across Europe now denounce the Brussels racket. In northern Europe, the EU is associated with mass immigration. In the South, with mass unemployment. Everywhere, with a loss of control. Even the newest members, Albania, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, are starting to regret their choice.In Brussels, though, life is good. Eurocrats continue to enjoy their lavish, tax-free perks.True, voters might not like what’s going on, but when did that ever stop them? Eurocrats have a long history of swatting aside inconvenient referendum results. Think of the way they responded to the French, Dutch, Danish and Irish “No” votes.The only time they might have been halted was on June 23, 2016. For a brief moment, it looked as thoughEurope might go in a different direction, based on democracy and national independence. But the moment passed. The opportunity was lost.Now, there is only decay.

What will happen now that Britain has left the EU?2016-6-24SO what happens now Britain has left the European Union?If you believe everything the Remain campaign has said you better batten down the hatches in preparation for a plague of locusts, the four horsemen of the apocalypse and a tidal wave of economic woes which are set to hit UK shores.Whereas Brexiteers claim we will now be like a freed “hostage” and rid of the “guzzling orgy of backslapping” Brussels bureaucrats.They claim we will be able to make Britain great again by taking back control of the billions sent to the EU every year, free to make our own laws and trade deals with the rest of the world.This morning leading EU politicians meet for crunch talks at 8.30am.The tug-of-war will now be over when Article 50 is triggered - the mechanism for leaving the EU.Once this is in motion the EU is notified of the UK's intention to withdraw.While EU bureaucrats will want this to kick in immediately to avoid a drawn out period of uncertainty, the PM and certainly Leave campaigners will want this to drag on for a significant period of time to negotiate informally with the other 27 member states.George Osborne has previously said this could in fact take place within two weeks whereas Vote Leave want this to be delayed so negotiations over the UK's withdrawal can be given longer to run.The process could take up to two years to take place with Liam Fox this morning suggesting negotiations might even spill over into 2019.The markets are set for a Brexit "bloodbath" this morning when they open at 8am, with sterling at a 30-year low at $1.33.The markets have reacted with every twist and turn of the referendum and unsurprisingly the pound has plummeted ever since Leave has looked on the cards.So expect more fireworks today. Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney is expected to make a statement this morning.Most economists had predicted a sharp drop in the value of the Pound if the UK voted to Leave, with even Brexiteers admitting there would be a slight “blip” in the event of leaving the EU.Brexit panic appears to be sweeping across the world markets with Japan shutting down trading briefly today after the share index fell by 1,000 points.Could further economic woes be in store?David Cameron will make a statement this morning to clarify his position.He has previously pledged to stay on, but will he have the fortitude to stick at it and lead negotiations on a position he doesn't believe in?Or will he be forced to resign by Brexit-backing Tories? Only time will tell.Tory big beasts have written a letter to David Cameron pleading with him to stay on, but backbench MPs aren't quite so forgiving of his tactics during the EU referendum campaign dubbed "Project Fear".Around 80 Tory MPs have already come out in support of the PM.It is unlikely he will be forced out of No10 before negotiations over the UK’s withdrawal are well under way with the leading Leavers demanding a period of “stability” in the event of a Brexit.What we do know for certain is that the PM is planning on quitting before the 2020 election and a vote to Leave would almost certainly bring his departure date forward.Leaving the EU is not as simple as pushing a button and it is unclear how the process will pan out – Greenland being the only part of a country to have ever left.Leaving will have to be negotiated with the other 27 members and the UK’s subsequent relationship with the EU is also on the table, including future trade deals.This involves rescinding the European Communities Act which allows EU laws to trump the UK’s and also sifting through around 80,000 pages of EU agreements from over five decades to decide which are repealed, amended or retained. Parliament will also want a say in this.This process could last up to two years, during which EU laws will still apply, Britain carries on paying into EU coffers and UK borders remain open to EU workers.Some Brexiteers want to stall triggering Article 50 to give the whole process more time - even stretching into 2019.Throughout the campaign some Brexiteers have been privately keen to put staying in the single market at the heart of any renegotiations with Brussels.In a recent interview Boris Johnson said he wanted “access” rather than membership of the single market.If the UK is able to negotiate such a deal it would be a “Single Market-Lite” model, paying tariffs or taxes in order to trade with the EU.Britain would also offer to maintain part of its £8.5billion a year contribution to the EU budget.In return Britain would expect to be able to withdraw from the free movement of people but allow a lesser “free movement of labour” which allows workers from the EU to come to the UK with a firm job offer.But in a stark warning to Britain, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the UK would be treated as a “third party” and have no access.Britain will leave the EU after two years from the date Article 50 is triggered, giving the PM time to strike new trade deals.Any deal has to be agreed by a majority of foreign government ministers on the council of the European Union, then ratified by member states before being agreed by European Parliament (separate to the council) and MPs at Westminster -  no wonder it will take up to two years.Remain campaigners claim if no agreement is struck, the UK will be left to trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules which would mean exporters are hit with their uniform import taxes or tariffs.But Leave campaigners say it is not in the EU’s interests to lose access to the British markets for its member states’ consumer goods and will be keen to strike a deal.The shock result has barely had time to sink in, but Nicola Sturgeon is already making noises about a Scottish break-away.Now it's clear Scotland almost unanimously voted to Remain and England choosing to Leave, the SNP will say it shows further evidence of a deepening divide between the will of the two nations.First Minister Ms Sturgeon stated that the Scottish people had made it "clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union".She has previously said this could be the "material change" in circumstances to prompt an independence referendum.Her predecessor Alex Salmond also piled in saying he was "quite certain" Ms Sturgeon would now be calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence.But pollsters suggest there is little change in the appetite for an independent Scotland since the last referendum. Then again - what do pollsters know?

WWII vets plead with Brits ‘don’t give away what we fought for’ urging voters to back Brexit2016-6-20WORLD War Two veterans yesterday begged the people of Britain to back Brexit – claiming the PM was “misleading” the British people to keep us in the EU.The five heroes blasted the EU as anti-democratic and said they had “served the country on land, sea and air to ensure that future generations could be free and independent”.Meeting the vets at a Berkshire airfield yesterday, Brexit backing Minister Priti Patel said she was “honoured”.“These people fought for our country, and on Thursday we need to vote for our democracy,” she said.“Defence of the realm is one of Government’s most basic duties.”She added: “The prospect of having our security policy dictated by Brussels is a huge concern – and makes a mockery of the claim that Britain is stronger in the EU.”Among the former serviceman Ms Patel met at White Waltham Airfield was 91-year-old Bryan Neely, who served in the RAF and remembered making Molotov cocktails at school in case of a Nazi invasion during the Second World War.“They thought we were on our backs at Dunkirk and they were wrong then. We went on to save Europe, and now we can save Europe again,” he said.Former Royal Engineer Colin Ashford insisted too much power had been given to Brussels: “We have seen a steady erosion of our democracy.”The 97-year-old was a veteran of Dunkirk, North Africa and Italy.He was joined by Flying Officer Bryan Neely, Lieutenant Tony Banks and Lieutenant Francis Goode.Their letter reads: “We never imagined 71 years ago that our country would be in this position.”“60 per cent of our laws are now made by faceless Brussels bureaucrats who are unelected, and the expanding EU military tells us that this is far more than just a trade bloc.“Before you the British People cast your vote in the referendum on Thursday, we want you to know, that’s not what we fought for!”They added: “Can you imagine how upsetting it is to us veterans that today we see our own politicians, and indeed our own Prime Minister, misleading the British people to keep us in the European Union?“The EU is not democratic, and indeed the whole of Europe which we liberated together with our Allies during the Second World War, needs to know that.”They told voters: “We plead with you. Please don’t give away everything we fought for. Please give your vote to our great country on Thursday.”The letter was organised by the Veterans for Britain which is part of the official Vote Leave campaign.They have previously warned that UK could be on the path towards an EU army, if we vote to stay in the EU on Thursday.More than 270 Brexit-backing former military officers recently used a letter to The Sun to tell serving heroes to make sure they have a say in the EU referendum – and vote Leave to save Britain.

Turkey fritterers2016-6-21IF Turkey joining the EU is a referendum “red herring”, how come the British people are paying £675million to bring it about?If David Cameron and other leaders really intend to block the Turks’ accession for the foreseeable future, why is a vast amount of our money being wasted on it — and when can we have it back?Imagine the thousands of doctors or nurses it could recruit, or the schools it could build.Imagine how it might ease the burden on those areas already bearing the brunt of the uncontrolled influx of migrants . . . where pay is stagnant and public services buckling.The Remain campaign is desperate to discredit the idea of almost 80 million Turkish citizens getting access to the EU because they know immigration could defeat them on Thursday.But how can they still pretend it won’t happen? British civil servants are busily working in “a dedicated team . . . on projects to improve Turkey’s prospects of joining the EU”.Mr Cameron has repeatedly backed the idea. In 2010 he wanted to “pave the road from Ankara to Brussels”.We have already bought the tarmac.And Remain’s denials make no allowance for Turkey having some leverage in the matter. Their President is already blackmailing Germany’s Angela Merkel into allowing them visa-free access to the Schengen area. What’s next?Now, you may not be bothered if our immigration numbers rocket even higher. But bear in mind, if you do care, that the Remain camp believes you unkind, closed-minded and intolerant.Any worries about immigration make you a bigot. Ask Gordon Brown.After all their ludicrous scare stories of poverty and war, Remain now hope to portray the big vote as a simple choice between good and evil.What an insult to the intelligence of voters, who recognise that these are complex issues. What a disgusting smear, too, on about half the country — including the friends, families and neighbours of many Remainers.Remain attack Nigel Farage’s antics, and fair enough.But there is nothing more instantly divisive than their own infantile, sanctimonious moralising. ANYONE can have second thoughts over the Brexit debate. We don’t blame Baroness Warsi for that. What baffles us is why anyone cares.She is an unelected Peer with form for jumping on bandwagons and performing 180-degree turns later.Like millions, she seems to have sat on the fence, flirting with Leave. Now she’s finally come down on the other side.So what? The suggestion that she is a coup for Remain is bonkers.We doubt the Baroness will change any minds but her own.

How will Brexit affect the economy and house prices?2016-6-21GEORGE Osborne has been peddling doom and gloom with his predictions for what will happen if Britain votes to leave the European Union.With his Project Fear mantra he claims the outlook for the British economy will be very bleak after Brexit.He says chaos and uncertainty could send the pound plummeting by 15% and government borrowing up by £39bn.And he has said families would be £4,300 a year worse off with Brexit.The Treasury’s short term impact report predicts 820,000 jobs will be lost and the average wage will sink by 4%, or between £800 and £1,400 a year.And the document suggests a vote for Brexit will wipe 6% off GDP and tip the UK into a year-long recession.But his nightmare scenario has been blasted by Brexiteers and questioned by the cross-party House of Commons Treasury Select Committee.The Treasury report says people would lose money with Brexit but economist Gerard Lyons says not even their own figures showed that.It expects the economy to be much bigger by 2030 than it is now, no matter how Britain votes in the EU referendum.But instead of reporting it this way the Treasury said the economy would be 6.2 per cent smaller with Brexit than if we remained in.Even so, Dr Lyons said that would still leave the UK economy almost 30 per cent larger with Brexit by 2030 than it is now.And the member of Economists for Brexit said the Government’s financial predictions are based on pessimistic assumptions about future policy including if we were to leave the EU we would not change our migration or regulation policy.Dr Lyons also said the Treasury has miscalculated the figure, and the Chancellor’s £4,300 loss per household should be reported as a long-term gain for each of us.George Osborne has warned house prices may fall by 18% if Britain votes for BrexitHe said it would be a lose-lose situation because despite homes being cheaper he claims it would be more difficult for first time buyers to get mortgages.And he says mortgage rates would go up.But Brexit-backing Cabinet minister Chris Grayling says voting to stay in the EU would make it difficult for people to get on the housing ladder – and even to be able to afford to rent a home.He says it is simple maths because if we cannot set limits on the numbers of people coming to Britain then it will make it more difficult for people to afford their own home.The Leader of the House of Commons says the more people trying to find homes, the more expensive they will be.And Lord Andrew Green, the chairman of Migration Watch UK, says at the present rate of immigration we have to build one home every four minutes to house migrants and their families.He says a vote to Remain will mean our ongoing housing crisis will only get worse.Remain campaigners say if Britain leaves the European Union then EU states would slap tariffs on us.And David Cameron says he was absolutely convinced the UK economy would suffer if we did vote to leave.But the Prime Minister has admitted that the EU’s share of global trade has fallen since Britain signed up for the Common Market in the early 1970s.If Britain was outside the European Union it would be free to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world – as well as the EU.Mr Cameron admits the UK desperately needs a trade deal with India, as we currently export more ‘services’ to tiny Luxembourg than one of the fastest growing economies in the entire world.Brexit-backers say Britain would thrive if it was allowed to negotiate trade deals outside of Brussels.Tory MEP and Out campaigner Dan Hannan says it is scaremongering of the Remain campaign to suggest EU states would impose tariffs on Britain.At the minute Britain is a great customer, buying £291billion of EU goods each year, more than the £240billion we sell to other EU states.Leave campaigners say the EU would not want to jeopardise this trade by bringing in tariffs.The Treasury dossier mapped up two different Brexit scenarios – ‘Shock’ and ‘Severe Shock’ – depending on whether Britain could cut a new trade deal with the EU within the mandated two year deadline.Mr Osborne is hoping Britain votes to stay in the EU so businesses can keep trading in the single market – and says this is the best way to keep the economy stable.This means countries can trade with each other without restrictions or tariffs.If Britain does vote to leave the EU then a trade deal would need to be thrashed out so we can keep exporting our goods to Europe, and they can sell goods back to us.But Brexiteer Boris Johnson says there is no need to be in the single market to export to it.Since the start of the single market in 1993 he says 36 countries – including the USA, India, New Zealand, Canada, and Brazil – have done better at exporting to the EU single market without being in it.And if Britain does leave the EU then it would be able to negotiate trade deals not just with the EU but countries all over the world.Among the business people who back Boris’s view are two of Britain’s biggest names – the man who reinvented everyday devices such as vacuum cleaners and hand dryers Sir James Dyson, and Lord Anthony Bamford  from JCB.Lord Bamford says there is ‘little to fear’ by quitting the EU and Sir James says the bloc is dominated by Germany and does not want to champion new technologies.

David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn call for tolerance and announce Parliament to be re-called in extraordinary joint statement on murder of MP Jo Cox2016-6-17DAVID Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn called for tolerance and announced Parliament will be recalled after the horrific murder of MP Jo Cox.The PM and the Labour leader said 'our nation is in shock' as they made an unprecedented joint statement to call for unity, close to the spot where the mum of two was slaughtered yesterday.Joined by Commons Speaker John Bercow, the pair leader paid their respects to the fallen MP and laid flowers in Birstall, West Yorkshire this afternoon.Mr Corbyn said he had asked the Prime Minister to recall MPs to Parliament on Monday to pay tribute to their 41-year-old colleague, and that this had been agreed.The House of Commons is currently not sitting due to the EU referendum on June 23.Speaking about Jo Cox's death Mr Cameron said: "Two children have lost their mother and a husband has lost his loving wife."Parliament has lost one of its most passionate campaigners and the nation is shocked."Today our nation is rightly shocked. And I think it is a moment to stand back and think about some of the things that are so important about our country.In tribute to Jo Cox, we must drive out hatred, division and intolerance where we find them in our public life and communities."The fact that we should treasure and value our democracy, where members of parliament are out in the public, accountable to the public and available to the public and that's how Jo died."She died doing her job."The PM went on to say: "Where we see hatred, where we find division, where we see intolerance we must drive it out of our politics and out of our public life and out of our communities.Jeremy Corbyn and I stood together to pay tribute to Jo Cox - an extraordinary and compassionate campaigning MP. pic.twitter.com/7SgxLOiRIK"If we truly want to honour Jo, then what we should do is recognise that her values - service, community, tolerance - the values she lived by and worked by, those are the values that we need to redouble in our national life in the months and years to come."Mother-of-two Mrs Cox was shot and stabbed in broad daylight yesterday near a library where she held regular constituency surgeries.A 52-year-old man, named locally as Tommy Mair, was arrested in connection and remain in police custody.The two party leaders paid tribute to the universally admired MP at a memorial set up in the Yorkshire town where mourners have been paying their respects.Mr Corbyn said of his Labour colleague: "She was taken from us in an act of hatred, in a vile act that has killed her. It's an attack on democracy, what happened yesterday."Jo was an exceptional, wonderful, very talented woman, taken from us in her early 40s when she had so much to give and so much of her life ahead of her."It's a tragedy beyond tragedy what has happened yesterday."He went on to say: "In her memory, we will not allow those people that spread hatred and poison to divide our society, we will strengthen our democracy, strengthen our free speech."She was a truly wonderful woman. I'm deeply sorry, deeply sad, for what has happened to her."My condolences to all the people of Batley and Spen who she represented so well, and of course to a wonderful family - her husband, her children and all of her wider family."In tearful scenes earlier today, fellow Labour MPs visited the spot to lay flowers for their fallen colleague.Heartbroken former shadow secretary Rachel Reeves broke down in tears as she told how the community had been left "numb and angry" by Mrs Cox's murder.“This is such a normal place,” she said."The sort of street that is recognisable in any part.“To think that such a horrific and violent crime took place against such a wonderful woman… there is a sense of numbness, not being able to believe what has happened.“And anger that someone could take away someone who had so much to give.“There is also grief and sorrow at the death of a mother, wife, daughter and a friend to many of us.”Here is David Cameron's full statement on Jo Cox's murder:“I first met Jo in Darfur in 2006 where she was doing what she was brilliant at, which was looking after and saving the lives of vulnerable refugees.“And here we are today commemorating her life that’s been lost.“And of course the most profound thing that has happened is that two children have lost their mother, a husband has lost a loving wife, and parliament has lost one of its most passionate and brilliant campaigners, someone who epitomised the fact that politics is about serving others.“Today our nation is rightly shocked. And I think it is a moment to stand back and think about some of the things that are so important about our country.“The fact that we should treasure and value our democracy, where members of parliament are out in the public, accountable to the public, available to the public, and that’s how Jo died.“She died doing her job.“I think the second thing is that we should recognise that politics is about public service.“People who go into public life, they want to act in the public interest, to pursue the national interest, to do things for other people, to make the country, make the world a better place.“Politicians disagree with each other. We often disregard what politicians say, disregard each other and the rest of it.“But at the end of the day that is what it is about, and that is what Jo showed it is all about.“But, perhaps, most important of all we should value and see as precious the democracy that we have on these islands were 65 million of us live together and work together and get on together.“We do have peace, we do have stability and we do have a measure of economic wellbeing better than other countries, obviously still to be spread far more widely.“And it is all underpinned by tolerance.“So where we see hatred, where we find division, where we see intolerance we must drive it out of our politics and out of our public life and out of our communities.“And if we truly want to honour Jo, then what we should do is recognise that her values - service, community, tolerance - the values she lived by and worked by, those are the values that we need to redouble in our national life in the months and years to come.”Shadow cabinet member Lucy Powell also paid a tearful tribute to Mrs Cox at the scene.As a mark of respect for Jo Cox MP our flag is flying at half-mast over Number 10 today pic.twitter.com/vpiOEBXOKHOther MPs chose to defiantly go ahead with their constituency surgeries in the wake of Mrs Cox's murder.The Union Jack flag flew at half mast today over the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and City Hall.With just days to go until the EU referendum, both Leave and Remain campaigns suspended hostilities in a symbol of unity.Downing Street also confirmed the Conservative party would not be contesting Mrs Cox's seat as a mark of respect.Ukip and the Lib Dems confirmed they too would not be fielding a candidate in the upcoming by-election.Here is Jeremy Corbyn's full statement on Jo Cox's murder:“We need our whole society to be secure. Jo was brutally murdered here 24 hours ago in this town - a town she loved, a town she grew up in, serving a community she loved."And in her life she'd worked for anti-slavery campaigns, she'd worked for Oxfam, she was a campaigner for human rights and justice all around the world."She was taken from us in an act of hatred, in a vile act that has killed her. It's an attack on democracy, what happened yesterday."Jo was an exceptional, wonderful, very talented woman, taken from us in her early 40s when she had so much to give and so much of her life ahead of her."It's a tragedy beyond tragedy what has happened yesterday."In her memory, we will not allow those people that spread hatred and poison to divide our society, we will strengthen our democracy, strengthen our free speech."She was a truly wonderful woman. I'm deeply sorry, deeply sad, for what has happened to her.“My condolences to all the people of Batley and Spen who she represented so well, and of course to a wonderful family - her husband, her children and all of her wider family.“I've asked the Prime Minister and Speaker for the recall of Parliament on Monday and they've accepted that request.“And Parliament will be recalled on Monday so that we can pay due tribute to her on behalf of everybody in this country who values democracy, values the right of free speech and values the right of political expression, free from the kind of brutality that Jo suffered."That's why we all need to come together to understand that everyone must have protection and security in order to function in a democratic society."

Jo Cox’s devastated husband urged to take her seat in Parliament2016-6-17JO Cox’s heartbroken husband is being urged by political friends to stand as an MP in the seat she held.Charity consultant Brendan Cox is already being seen as the perfect replacement for her in the safe Labour constituency of Batley and Spen.The 37-year-old former Labour special adviser who once worked in No10 has been an activist since his student days.Mr Cox also won huge plaudits for his moving statement honouring his wife and calling for Britain to reject hate just a few hours after her death.A Labour MP who was close to Jo told The Sun: “It is very early days, and Brendan will want to give this a lot of serious thought – not least, about how he will look after his young children.“But in a lot of people’s view already, he would be the perfect replacement for Jo.“It would also be a lovely thing to honour her legacy of internationalism and helping the needy around the world which Brendan fully shares.”A by-election to pick Jo Cox’s successor for the West Yorks constituency is likely to be held either next month or in September after the summer holidays.The Conservatives, the Lib Dems and UKIP all said yesterday they wouldn’t contest the seat in a tribute to Jo.A Tory spokesman said giving Labour a free run at holding the seat would be “a mark of respect to a much-loved and respected politician”.Earlier this year, Gill Furniss succeeded her husband Harry Harpham as Labour MP for Sheffield Brightside after he died of cancer.

Boris Johnson urges Sun readers ‘with history in their hands’ to back Brexit2016-6-22BORIS JOHNSON urged millons of Sun readers "holding history in their hands" to back a Brexit — and “let the Lion roar again”.Speaking on the eve of the biggest vote for two generations the Tory heavyweight said the Leave campaign was “on the verge of history”.And he told wavering voters it was time to “cry freedom” by BeLeaving in Britannia — and throwing off the shackles of the European Union.He was speaking to the Sun during a whistlestop 500 mile tour of Britain where he was asked to kiss a fish in London, flew by helicopter to a former WWII airfield and ended the day pulling pints in the north-east.He was met by hordes of Out voters everywhere he went, stopping for selfies every 10 metres before joking: “Where are these Remain supporters the polls keep telling us about?”But with experts claiming today’s Referendum is still too close to call, the Brexit standard bearer implored Sun readers to make the crucial difference and make June 23 ‘Independence Day’.In a passionate Churchillian-style plea, he branded the Referendum a “Battle for British democracy”.And he said: “Sun readers have the future of our country in their hands.“They represent the best of Britain, the best of British instinct, and I know they believe in our great country and I hope very much they want to take our country forward tommorow on a path toward greater democracy, greater openness to trade with the rest of the world and a more dynamic future for Britain.“They know the brave cross they put on the ballot paper can make the difference between restoring democracy in Europe or remaining shackled to Europe.“It will be a historic moment.”And he stormed: “It’s time to take the chains off the giant, unshackled Britannia and let the Lion roar again!”As BoJo flew the flag, fellow Brexit backing Tory Michael Gove hit the south coast with Armed Forces Minister Penny Mordaunt.Speaking on the campaign trail in Bournemouth, Mr Gove warned a vote for Remain today would mean it was “game over” for Great Britain as Brussels would never change their ways.He said the Eurocrats running the EU would “never reform”.Separately, Out campaiging Jobs Minister Priti Patel delivered a rousing battle cry to vote leave — urging votes to “take back our destiny”.She warned it was Brits’ “last chance to keep our democracy” because if we vote to Remain we would be “settling for whatever crumbs Angela Merkel was willing to drop.”But in a frantic last day’s campaigning a clearly exhausted Boris Johnson was the champion for the Brexit cause.Despite a two-hour live TV debate on Tuesday night the former Mayor of London was up before dawn to start his 500 mile whirlwind campaign tour by car, plane and helicopter.He began at Billingsgate fish market in London he shook hands and posed for selfies with traders who backed his stance on a Brexit - in part because of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy.He posed with a salmon offered by a fish porter.As photographers urged him to kiss the fish he revealed he had “once kissed a crocodile in Australia”.He drove to Maldon, Essex where he had time to buy a copy of the Sun on a walk through the town.He told activists: “I do think we are on the verge, possibly, of an extraordinary event in the history of our country and indeed in the whole of Europe.”Lorry drivers hooted their horns in support as he met locals in Ashby-de-la Zouch in Leicestershire before he visited Wolverhampton.He then flew to Selby in Yorkshire, landing by helicopter at Burn airfield, a former WWII site for Bomber Command.On descent he quipped “Let’s put on Ride of the Valkyries” in a reference to a classic scene from the film Apocalyspe Now.Speaking to the Sun among a wall of well wishers wanting photos, the man critics claim is only in the campaign for his own political career insisted his passion for the cause had only grown since he came out for a Brexit in February.He confirmed separately yesterday to the BBC that at one stage he had written two letters to the PM -one backing Remain and the other a Brexit, the one he eventually sent.But he told the Sun he had only become “more certain” a Brexit was the right thing to do the longer the campaign has gone on.And he urged Brits to consider what would happen if we vote to Remain.He said: “We will be locked to a system that can only get worse.“We will forever be subservient to a supra-natioal, federalist state.”Dismissing Downing Street’s arguments a Brexit was a leap into the dark, he said it was a “stride into the light”.“There’s a great sunlit meadow out there.“We have just got to open the door.”Batting off criticism the Leave campaign was anti-immigrant, he said he loved immigration and Britain’s multi-cultural society, but Britain had to take back control, and he reassured Sun readers he firmly believed net migration of 184,000 EU nationals a year was far too high.He promised a vote to leave the EU would see immigration fall by the end of the current Parliament.Pulling a pint at the end of the day in the George Pub at Piercebridge, Co Durham he urged supporters to “drive for the line”.Asked about his own stamina, he smiled: “Hard as nails.”As he played barman, Mr Gove in Bournemouth said all the evidence suggested millions of voters were still to make up their minds.And he said: “I get the impression there are some people who believe we should leave the European Union but their’s is a quiet and polite patriotism.“I think you’ve got to take this opportunity to take this once in a lifetime opportunity to leave because if we vote to remain I don’t think we’ll be in a stronger position to reform the European Union.”With him, Tory rising star Penny Mordaunt insisted Brexit supporters should not be made to “feel guilty” or be told they are “narrow minded little Islanders”.She said: “That is quite wrong — these people believe in their country, they believe in what it is capable of if it has the freedom that it needs to thrive.“This is an attempt to make people feel guilty about what they know in their hearts and their heads is the right thing for them and their families and it is a sign that they have lost the arguments.”0445: Leaves home in London drives to Billingsgate (5 miles)0515: Tours Billingsgate fish market -

It’s not EU, it’s me… Europe is like a broken marriage and I’ll be voting to leave2016-6-21LET’S face it, for those still undecided on how to vote in the EU referendum tomorrow, the “facts and figures” being churned out by both sides have now become little more than white noise.In. Out. In. Out. What’s it all about?There are plenty of ditherers like me — one in eight to be precise. And with the polls showing Remain and Leave as pretty much neck and neck, the politicians know that we are the critical mass.So, it’s time to s**t or get off the pot, as my old grandma used to say, and I will do so by way of an analogy.If the EU was your husband or wife, what would you do?Do you settle for a life of discontent simply because the uncertainty of going it alone scares you?You’ve been together for 41 years and you still have strong feelings for them, but your gut instinct tells you it’s just not working. They seem remote, self-obsessed, unconcerned by your needs and wholly dismissive of your rich contribution to the relationship over the years.They spend more money than they bring in, hold regular “everyone’s welcome” parties without consulting you or planning the catering or accommodation and generally dictate what you can and can’t do while blithely doing as they please without fear of sanction.And when you try to sit down with them to explain how you hope relations might improve between you in the future, they practically laugh in your face.OK, so they don’t beat you up or cheat on you with their pneumatic secretary, but is that enough to warrant spending the rest of your born days with a control freak who takes you for granted?The dilemma is a simple one.Do you settle for a life of discontent simply because the uncertainty of going it alone scares you?I love Europe and always will. And my plans to one day semi-retire to France won’t change eitherOr do you stop enabling the unsatisfactory status quo and walk away, giving the message loud and clear that you’re not a pushover and that any relationship in the future will be on your terms as well as theirs?They might flounce off and put on a good show of having a fabulous time with their friends. That’s the risk you take with ultimatums.However, given your strength of character, self-sufficient nature and go-getting spirit, it wouldn’t be the end of the world. But far more likely, chances are they’ll miss you terribly, realise the error of their ways and, after a few late night Pastis or Schnapps, pick up the phone to say they’ll change if it means getting you back.Which is why, tomorrow I will be voting to leave the EU.I love Europe and always will. And my plans to one day semi-retire to France won’t change either.But I hope that a vote to leave will prove the catalyst for much-needed reform in Brussels, a move away from bloated centralisation and back towards a more democratic and flexible arrangement where we — and the other clearly dissatisfied EU countries just waiting to see what we do — are each in control of our own tiller but steering towards the common aim of a strong, remodelled “Europe”.We will be in control of our own borders, set and follow our own laws and be in charge of our own purse strings.We will free our business and manufacturing from excessive red tape, exercise good old common sense when necessary without it being bludgeoned at birth by over-zealous EU regulation and, best of all, hold politicians to account because there will be no more “Europe won’t let us do it”.And yes, we will still be compassionate to those in need.Vote Leave.LAST week, I wrote the following about the cold-blooded killer who sauntered in to Pulse nightclub in Orlando and gunned down 49 innocent souls.“Much as Omar Mateen would like us to think of him as a jihadi warrior, the more pedestrian truth is probably that he was just a deeply disturbed young man dissatisfied with his own life and suffering from mental health issues that tipped him over the edge.”This week the name and claimed political allegiance may differ, but time will tell whether mental illness, rather than political fanaticism, was the driving force behind the senseless killing of MP Jo Cox.Until then, let’s focus on the good it has highlighted among the majority of right-minded people in this country.The constituents who knew her and openly wept for her, the complete strangers who have donated nearly £1million already to her favoured charities, her devastated loved ones, and Bernard Kenny, the brave pensioner stabbed by her attacker as he tried to help.And of course, Jo herself.A devoted wife and mother who worked tirelessly to juggle the demands of home with the work of being a proper, grassroots MP who cared deeply about her constituents and fought passionately on the local issues that affected them.God rest her soul.THIS week’s cover of Hello! magazine is a gorgeous photograph of proud parents Ronnie Wood and Sally Humphreys with their newborn baby girls.Presumably it was taken with a fast shutter as both of the wee bairns are asleep at the same time.Talking of which, both the Rolling Stone and his theatre producer wife have those slightly rictus grins that scream: “Can we get on with this so we can get some much-needed kip in before they wake up?”THE Queen telling Prince William to “stand up” after he crouched to speak to his young son while on the Buckingham Palace balcony encapsulated perfectly their vastly differing styles.William’s attitude is largely family first, duty second. But his far wiser grandmother knows that duty and, more importantly, knowing when to maintain a sense of occasion, has kept the royals where they are for centuries.And that doing something so charmingly ordinary in view of millions of your subjects could puncture that vital mystique to the extent that by the time William and Kate come to the throne, the “monarchy” will be greatly diminished and they’ll be using cabs, not carriages.THREE 12-year-old girls are now in a stable condition following at least two of them  fighting for their lives after reportedly taking three ecstasy pills each, nicknamed “teddy tablets”.It’s not yet known if the girls were fully aware of what they were taking, but no doubt the truth will emerge once the police have completed their investigation.As parents, we can never guarantee that our children remain safe at all times – all we can ever do is teach them about life’s dangers and hope that, where possible, they manage to avoid them.But one undisputed fact from this story did leap out at me.They fell ill while wandering round a Greater Manchester shopping centre at 10pm on  Saturday night.Surely far too late for three such young and clearly naive girls to be out alone?STAFF at a rental garage in Swindon found a buzzard stuck in a van’s front grille and dismantled the vehicle to get the injured bird out.He had a dislocated leg and broken wing but is now recuperating at a rescue sanctuary.A happier outcome, thankfully, than his birdy chum who clearly flew in to actress Anna Friel’s front grille at Ascot and stayed there.THIS is former Strictly dancer Kristina Rihanoff leaving her baby shower party and reportedly “weeks” from giving birth.Weeks?Ye Gods. It looks more like mere seconds, poor love.

The EU is kaput … It’s time to make a dash for the Emergency Brexit2016-6-19IF the history of our country tells us anything, it is surely that the British can never be bullied into submission.Luftwaffe bombs couldn’t do it. The IRA couldn’t do it. Islamic State can’t do it.So what hope did a couple of trust fund toffs like David Cameron and George Osborne ever have of scaring us?The Prime Minister and the Chancellor — the two-faced champion and chief cheerleader of the Remain campaign — have given us no positive reasons to vote to stay in the European Union.Instead of any hopeful, optimistic message, they have attempted to browbeat, intimidate and frighten the British people.Osborne’s threat to respond to Brexit with savage cuts and punitive tax rises is only the latest example of their bullying.The fact that George never says he will have to cut the bloated foreign aid budget reveals the pathetic emptiness of his threats.Even in the midst of economic meltdown, there will still be that £12billion a year to buy private jets and London mansions for Third World despots!Who can blame the other countries of Europe from wanting to obliterate their miserable histories?Cameron, Osborne and their Remain allies talk about our country as if it is a timid, self-loathing and pitiful little nation that would shrivel and die outside the EU.This is garbage.There are 195 countries in the world and only 28 of them are in the European Union.If the likes of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Tonga can be proud, independent, self-governing nations, then why can’t we?Cameron, Osborne, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, William Hague and all the rest of Remain’s miserable shower of yesterday’s men have continually talked this country down.From the beginning to the end of this referendum campaign, they have spoken about our country as if it is incapable of surviving outside the EU.And millions of us simply do not believe them.We KNOW that our country is better than they give it credit for.We are the fifth largest economy in the world.We are the oldest Parliamentary democracy on the planet.We are a cultural superpower.London can reasonably claim to be the capital of the world.And unlike almost every other nation in the European Union, we have a past that we are proud of.Who can blame the other countries of Europe from wanting to obliterate their miserable histories?The story of modern Europe is a tragic litany of Fascism, Communism and foreign occupation.If the British have always felt slightly apart from these troubled lands, it is because we never needed anyone to set us free.The Prime Minister constantly lied to the British people. It is worse than spin. It is worse than slippery political languageThis EU referendum has not been our democracy’s finest hour.I am one of the 11 million suckers who voted for Cameron at the General Election — and gave him that unexpected victory — because when he looked the British people in the eye and swore us he would get a new deal for our country in the European Union, I did not doubt him for one second.Cameron had always acted as if he detested the undemocratic, corrupt EU as much as the rest of us.Certainly the stinking hypocrite always bashed Brussels when he wanted a standing ovation at the Tory party conference.He unequivocally stated that, inside or outside the European Union, our nation would succeed.As recently as last November, Cameron said: “No one doubts that Britain is a proud, successful, thriving country. Whether we could be successful outside the EU — that’s not the question.”But the Prime Minister constantly lied to the British people.It is worse than spin. It is worse than slippery political language.No ifs, no buts — Cameron lied.He lied when he said he would reduce immigration to the “tens of thousands”.He lied again when he vowed he would fight for a new deal for Britain inside the EU — or lead the campaign to leave.And — so soon after assuring us that we could “thrive” outside the EU — he is lying to us now with his dark warnings of national collapse if we dare to claim our country back.But this referendum is not about the Prime Minister.And it is not about the leadership of the Conservative Party.It is about the destiny of our country.Only one continent on the planet has weaker economic growth than Europe — AntarcticaDo we really want to remain part of the European Union when it so obviously is not working?The currency is kaput. The borders are kaput.The immigration policy is a bloody shambles, encouraging the rise of vicious extremists across Europe and ripping at social cohesion by importing alien cultures.Yet even as the EU falls apart, it dreams of expanding, sucking in poor countries like Serbia, Montenegro and Turkey.Despite its delusions of grandeur, the EU’s share of the world economy is in sharp decline.Only one continent on the planet has weaker economic growth than Europe — Antarctica.The European Union is a 20th century idea that has had its day.All empires eventually slip into the mists of history.Why should the EU — with its mad dream of a United States of Europe, repellent to millions of us — be any different?The EU claims to drive prosperity and peace.But this waning empire makes nobody prosperous and nobody safe.Prosperous? Monetary union — the Euro — has been a disaster.In the 19 member states that have adopted the Euro, there are 16.4 million unemployed — many of them driven into exile to the UK.Unable to escape the straitjacket of the Euro, proud countries like Greece, Spain and Italy find they are the paupers of the western world.All the eye-swivelling EU groupies urging us to stay once predicted the UK was doomed if we did not ditch the pound.They were laughably wrong. The Euro does not work and it will never work.So does the EU keep us safe?Last year there were two terrorist atrocities in the centre of Paris, enabled by the absence of borders between France and Belgium.When Turkey joins the EU — and Cameron has actively supported Turkish membership — the EU will share a common external border with Syria, Iran and Iraq.That will make us nice and safe.The EU’s porous borders do not work in an age of Islamic terror.When German Chancellor Angela Merkel took the unilateral decision to welcome more than one million Muslims to her country in 2015, the silly old Frau laid out the welcome mat to the Third World, changing Europe’s culture forever with her insanely reckless gesture.Because when these newcomers receive their shiny new EU passports, they are free — like the other 508 million citizens of the EU, to live in the UK.For the EU is built on what is called the four freedoms — the freedom of movement of capitals, goods, services and people. Like it or lump it.The reason the freedom of movement can never work for the British is because so many millions around this unhappy little planet desperately want to live here.This has nothing to do with anyone’s race, religion or creed — it has everything to do with numbers.No nation of earth can accommodate literally limitless numbers of newcomers.Yet that is what the EU compels the UK to do.And as long as we stay in the European Union, our control over immigration from other member states is non-existent.That is why the Remain camp is so loathe to even mention immigration — and why they are so quick to shriek “Racist!” at anyone who does.They know that while we stay in the EU, we cannot do the one thing that every nation should do — control our own borders.The EU does not care how hard it is for you to find a home, or if your child cannot get into the local school or if your GP can’t see you this week, or if there is no hospital bed for your elderly parent, or if the crush on your morning commute recalls the black hole of Calcutta.Your quality of life means nothing to the unelected Eurocrats of Brussels, who have no love or loyalty for this nation, and no affection for our people, and no respect for our history and traditions.It beggars belief that this proud island — where no foreign invader landed for a thousand years — could meekly surrender its independence to the EU, the freedom that other generations fought and died for.So when I place my vote on Thursday, I shall think of my father, Victor William Robert Parsons, who fought for his country as a Royal Naval Commando in World War Two and came home with a Distinguished Service Medal and a body that was a mass of scar tissue.I will remember my father because our country’s freedom — its right to be proud, independent and self-governing — is held in trust for future generations.Nobody has the right to give that freedom away. And that is why I would crawl across broken glass to vote Leave on Thursday.Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team? Email us at tips@the-sun.co.uk or call 0207 782 4368

WWII vets plead with Brits ‘don’t give away what we fought for’ urging voters to back Brexit2016-6-20WORLD War Two veterans yesterday begged the people of Britain to back Brexit – claiming the PM was “misleading” the British people to keep us in the EU.The five heroes blasted the EU as anti-democratic and said they had “served the country on land, sea and air to ensure that future generations could be free and independent”.Meeting the vets at a Berkshire airfield yesterday, Brexit backing Minister Priti Patel said she was “honoured”.“These people fought for our country, and on Thursday we need to vote for our democracy,” she said.“Defence of the realm is one of Government’s most basic duties.”She added: “The prospect of having our security policy dictated by Brussels is a huge concern – and makes a mockery of the claim that Britain is stronger in the EU.”Among the former serviceman Ms Patel met at White Waltham Airfield was 91-year-old Bryan Neely, who served in the RAF and remembered making Molotov cocktails at school in case of a Nazi invasion during the Second World War.“They thought we were on our backs at Dunkirk and they were wrong then. We went on to save Europe, and now we can save Europe again,” he said.Former Royal Engineer Colin Ashford insisted too much power had been given to Brussels: “We have seen a steady erosion of our democracy.”The 97-year-old was a veteran of Dunkirk, North Africa and Italy.He was joined by Flying Officer Bryan Neely, Lieutenant Tony Banks and Lieutenant Francis Goode.Their letter reads: “We never imagined 71 years ago that our country would be in this position.”“60 per cent of our laws are now made by faceless Brussels bureaucrats who are unelected, and the expanding EU military tells us that this is far more than just a trade bloc.“Before you the British People cast your vote in the referendum on Thursday, we want you to know, that’s not what we fought for!”They added: “Can you imagine how upsetting it is to us veterans that today we see our own politicians, and indeed our own Prime Minister, misleading the British people to keep us in the European Union?“The EU is not democratic, and indeed the whole of Europe which we liberated together with our Allies during the Second World War, needs to know that.”They told voters: “We plead with you. Please don’t give away everything we fought for. Please give your vote to our great country on Thursday.”The letter was organised by the Veterans for Britain which is part of the official Vote Leave campaign.They have previously warned that UK could be on the path towards an EU army, if we vote to stay in the EU on Thursday.More than 270 Brexit-backing former military officers recently used a letter to The Sun to tell serving heroes to make sure they have a say in the EU referendum – and vote Leave to save Britain.
