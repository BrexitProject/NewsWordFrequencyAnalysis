'Get out ASAP' EU tells Britain to hurry up and LEAVE after landmark Brexit vote2016-06-24GETTYWhile the landmark decision was taken by Brits in yesterday's EU Referendum – with an unexpected victory for the Leave camp – the process of quitting the union could take up to two years.But while British Government begins producing a timetable for exit in the wake Prime Minister David Cameron's shocking announcement he will be stepping down.Senior EU represenatives said the UK should implement Brexit "as soon as possible, however painful that process may be" warning "any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty".“We now expect the United Kingdom Government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be”David Cameron has said there will be no rush to begin the formal withdrawal, saying no decision on invoking the Clause 50 process would be taken for at least three months.Some senior pro-Brexit campaigners have suggested it may not have to be invoked at all, seeking instead less formal negotiations over the future relationship with Brussels.But, in a joint statement, European Council president Donald Tusk, European Parliament president Martin Schulz, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, holder of the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker made clear they expected swift progressThey said: "In a free and democratic process, the British people have expressed their wish to leave the European Union. We regret this decision but respect it."We now expect the United Kingdom Government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be."Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty. We have rules to deal with this in an orderly way."Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union sets out the procedure to be followed if a member state decides to leave the European Union."We stand ready to launch negotiations swiftly with the United Kingdom regarding the terms and conditions of its withdrawal from the European Union."They said EU law "continues to apply to the full, to and in the United Kingdom, until it is no longer a member" and that the concessions agreed as part of Mr Cameron's renegotiation would be abandoned.They said they hoped the UK would remain "a close partner of the European Union also in the future".However, they added EU would "stand strong and uphold the EU's core values of promoting peace and the well-being of its peoples" as a 27-nation blocQuestions remain over how the Brexit will impact Brits and currently the British Pound is in freefall as the markets react badly to the Leave vote.There is already speculation as to the future of the EU as far-right leaders make controversial comments about their status in the bloc, and at home the starting gun for the next Prime Minister has been fired.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could be ousted from his position after the Remain campaign's failure, and White House wannabe presidential candidate Donald Trump praised the Brexit on his visit to Scotland.

EU vote: Campaign bullies have squeezed our ballots but now it's down to YOU2016-06-23GETTY+++ Polling stations across the country opened at 7am +++Ukip leader Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn have also voted.In one of the dirtiest campaigns in British political history, David Cameron, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Michael Gove gave their closing speeches before record numbers of voters head to polling stations today.Voters have said respect for political figures is at an all time low after weeks of bullying and nastiness.But there was no let-up yesterday as both sides seized on comments from Mr Juncker who insisted “out is out”.He said: “We have concluded a deal with the Prime Minister.GETTYPAPAGETTYGETTY“Jean-Claude Juncker directly contradicts the PM”“He got the maximum he could receive, and we gave the maximum we could give, so there will be no kind of renegotiation.”Leave campaigner Nigel Farage said the EU boss’s statement seemed to undermine Mr Cameron’s promise to fight for further changes.The PM had said he would seek new free movement rules and added the process of EU reform will “continue" today.Mr Farage insisted Cameron’s claims were now a pipe dream as he tweeted: “Jean-Claude Juncker directly contradicts the PM. There is no further renegotiation.”But last night the Ukip leader pulled out of a Channel 4 Brexit debate at the last minute.Vote Leave campaign leader Boris also seized on Mr Juncker’s quotes to say: “This gives the game away. If we stay in there is no prospect of any further change.“This is it, folks. We have been told from the horse’s mouth that any hope of further change is absolute illusion.”Mr Cameron insisted he expects to remain PM even if voters choose Brexit, telling the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “I will accept the instructions of the British people and get to work on Friday morning to deliver them.”Boris agreed he should “stay under any circumstances”.Former PM Sir John Major branded the Brexit camp “the grave-diggers of our prosperity” who would have to answer for their “lies” during the referendum campaign.GETTYGETTYOn the key battleground of immigration, Mr Cameron insisted that reducing net migration was “not an unrealistic ambition”.Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: “Don’t blame the migrant worker for being exploited, blame the company that’s exploiting them.”He said the EU was not perfect but was the best “cross-border framework for defending living standards, rights and protections for our people”.Speaking at a London rally, he added: “We believe to remain will be able to help us reform the European Union and would be right for people in this country.”Meanwhile prominent Leave campaigner Michael Gove said sorry after comparing economists who have warned of the dangers of Brexit to scientists in the pay of the Nazis who smeared Albert Einstein.

EU referendum: Horny Brits shun vote for Brexit BONKATHON2016-06-22GETTYInstead of putting an X in the box on the EU ballot paper, they’ve voted for XXX-rated romps with complete strangers.And one cheeky duo – holding a swingers’ party for ten couples on the day of the historic vote – have even ordered a batch of Boris Johnson, David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn masks so guests can bed their favourite politician.Eric The Red posted an ad on a sex site advertising the champagne-fuelled free-for-all – called the Brexit Bonkathon – with a break for nibbles at a luxury home near Manchester.SG“Hi guys, lets stick two fingers up to the Brexit vote and have some fun”He said: "Hi guys, lets stick two fingers up to the Brexit vote and have some fun."I’m looking for ten couples to join us in our luxury home near Manchester. There’ll be champagne, wine, beer and nibbles."My good lady wife is even ordering some political masks so you can bonk Boris, cuddle Cameron and kiss Corbyn! Let’s make it a night to remember because whatever happens we’ll still all be Europeans in the morning."Please reply with pics so I can get the guest list going. Vote Sexit!”Another swinger on a different site was also arranging a sex party for Thursday.He wrote: “Anyone want to join my wife and I on Thursday night for some good old fashioned fun. who cares about the bloody Brexit vote? a bit of wife swapping gets my vote. Looking for three couples max.”SGAnd on a site set up so the clients of prostitutes can swap notes and rate their favourite sex workers, a fierce debate raged about whether a vote to leave the EU would mean an increase in the price of vice.One worried punter wrote: "The price of pussy will go up! For a couple of reasons:"A plunge in the £ will make it less attractive for foreign hookers to come here."E.g. if £ falls 15% the escort has to raise her prices by 15% to send the same amount of money home that she would have had before brexit."The price of ALL imports will rise. Harder for foreign escorts to enter the country, which will lower the supply and increase the price."GETTYBut another self-declared expert on the financial impact exiting the EU would have on the cost of sex said that view was “rubbish”.And he added: "Most escorts are from countries not in euro or dollar."Even if Britain leaves the EU and IF sterling goes down a fairly sizeable amount against euro or dollar, doubt it will change much against the Romanian Leu or even the Zloty."Most escorts will still earn vastly more than the pittance they get back home and so there "will be enough escorts charging a similar rate, even if some try it on."As for the bit about them finding it hard to get into the country, I'm not sure if you've read the comments on this thread. How do you think Brazilians, Russians, Thais etc get in."

Conspiracy theorists claim footage shows Brexit vote counter rubbing out cross on ballot2016-06-24The clip was spotted during a Sky News broadcast before it was announced that Britain would leave the EU.There is of course no way to prove the counter was rubbing out a vote and the clip could just as easily show her rubbing out a spoil on the paper.But with the anger surrounding “pencilgate”, theorists will use the clip as further fuel to their fire.Voters had already complained about the use of pencils in polling stations, claiming it made it easier to rig votes.One woman was given a stern talking to after she lent her pen to voters.LIVELEAKLIVELEAK“The use of pencils does not in itself increase the likelihood of electoral fraud”The footage, posted to video sharing site LiveLeak, had mixed responses from viewers.One said: “No... election fraud.. say it isn't so. Pencils….”But another added: “We don't know what she did, it may have been the Times Cross word puzzle for all the OP knows!”Jordan Lawrence, representing the Electoral Commission, said there was no link to the use of pencils and spoiled votes.PAHe added: “The use of pencils does not in itself increase the likelihood of electoral fraud: while pencil marks can be rubbed out, similarly, pen marks can be crossed out."What is key is that the integrity of the process from the point that a voter marks their ballot paper to the declaration of the result is maintained.”Rigging votes in the UK is illegal and is classed as electoral fraud.Following the shock result that saw a narrow victory for the Leave campaign, David Cameron resigned as Prime Minister.He said: “The country requires free leadership to take it in this direction."I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I don't think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination."And the result could have a seismic impact on the life of many Britons.Already, the value of the pound has dropped to its lowest value since 1985.Both Scotland and Northern Ireland are also threatening independence from the UK.But Leave campaigners have hailed the result, with UKIP leader Nigel Farage claiming it was “a victory for real people”.

Neo-Nazi leader claims killed MP Jo Cox ‘put a target on her back’2016-06-20PA/SWNS/NATIONAL ALLIANCEThomas Mair – who has been charged following the shooting of Ms Cox – was sent an invoice for £430 worth of books by the National Alliance including information on how to make a homemade pistol.But Will Williams – leader of the National Alliance – claimed he felt “no guilt” about the attack.He also said alleged killer Mair was the consequence of her political opinions.NATIONAL ALLIANCEMrs Cox, Labour MP for Batley and Spen, was attacked in the street outside a meeting with constituents in Birstall.West Yorkshire Police said Birstall local Mair has been charged with four charges including murder.National Alliance leader Mr Williams said: “I hear that she loves the idea of bringing a bunch of Muslim refugees from Syria or wherever.PA“You can see how people would be opposed to that.“So she put a target on her back. Mair is the effect.“The cause is clear to him and he’s reacting. That’s how I look at it.”SWNSNational Alliance’s founder William Pierce’s book The Turner Diaries is said to have inspired US terrorist Timothy McVeigh to kill 168 people in 1995.Mair gave his name as "Death to traitors, freedom for Britain" as he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Saturday.After the court fell silent, he was asked to repeat his name to which he said: "My name is Death to traitors, freedom to Britain."

Britain’s immigration crisis: How leaving the EU could change this2016-06-23PABritain’s struggle to curb immigration has been one of the most high-profile and controversial issues of the hard-fought campaign in recent weeks.One of the most memorable images has been Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage standing in front of his “breaking point” poster showing a vast queue of refugees.The Remain camp has roundly condemned the anti-migrant poster and even leading Eurosceptic Tory Michael Gove admitted he “shuddered” when he saw it.Chancellor George Osborne argued that there is a difference between “whipping up division”, as done by the poster, and the need to address real immigration concerns.As accusations continue to fly in the final hours of the campaign, here is a look at how Brexit could help the UK deal with the immigration crisis.PABritain would regain more control over immigration because Brexit would bring to an end the free movement of EU migrants in and out of Britain.The right of EU citizens to live and work in any member states is guaranteed by the EU’s founding principle of the “free movement of people”.Even Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has admitted that there cannot be an upper limit on immigration “while you have the free movement of labour”.David Cameron’s EU deal would mean that new EU immigrants could not access full in-work benefits until they have been here for four years.PAAs the referendum campaign progressed, Brexit campaigners have increasingly focused on public concerns about immigration in order to win over voter.Vote Leave chair and Labour MP Gisela Stuart stressed that uncontrolled immigration was putting pressure on housing and public services such the NHS.Ms Stuart said: “The only way to get a fairer immigration policy and to bring in an Australian-style points-based system is to vote leave.”At the start of this month, leading Vote Leave politicians said migrants should be admitted based on their skills “without discrimination on the ground of nationality”.Immigration is a legitimate concern, but it’s not a good reason to leave the EU @yorkshirepost #Remain #StrongerInhttps://t.co/FSsu8ggZTnRemain campaigners have acknowledged concerns over immigration, but they argue that pulling Britain out of the EU is the wrong way to deal with them.Mr Cameron said that Britain should reduce immigration within the EU, adding: "It would be madness to try to do that by trashing our economy and pulling out of the single market.”The murder of pro-EU MP Jo Cox has changed the tone of the immigration debate. Mrs Cox stressed the benefits of immigration such as the number of EU health professionals here.She recently wrote in the Yorkshire Post: “I strongly believe that concerns about immigration – as legitimate as they are – are not a reason to vote for Brexit.”Last month it was revealed that net migration to the UK rose to a whopping 333,000 in 2015 - the second highest figure on record.Mr Cameron has pledged to cut migration to under 100,000. But home affairs committee chairman MP Keith Vaz said it would “take a modern miracle” to do so.His former aide Steve Hilton, who backs Brexit, said: “When I was working in government, we were told, by officials, that as long as we were in the EU we couldn't control the level of immigration.”The plague-like disease which eats the flesh of dogs alive has spread from southern England to the Midlands, Wales, Lancashire, Scotland and Ireland.

Premier League boss: ‘UK will not be respected if we leave the EU’2016-06-20GETTY\MARK LEECHExecutive chairman Richard Scudamore said opposition to the EU would be "incongruous" in the context of the league's commitment to "openness".Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Mr Scudamore, who was not speaking on behalf of the league's 20 member clubs, criticised Brexit supporters' belief that leaving the EU would reclaim British sovereignty.He said: ”Nobody bears the scars more than me of having to go and negotiate in Brussels and try and organise things a little bit in our interests in terms of the European machine."Ultimately you can't break away, you can't just pull out, you have to get in and negotiate and try and organise and try and influence."GETTY\TOM DULAT“We would just be, I think, respected less around the world for not wanting to be part of something”As well as opposing the ethos of the Premier League, the football chief said Britain risked losing its international respect if it were to leave the EU.He said: "We would just be, I think, respected less around the world for not wanting to be part of something."He added: "That doesn't seem to sit very well when you travel the world like we do being welcomed because of the fact that we are open for business, open for discussion, and open for cooperation.GETTY"There is an openness about the Premier League which I think it would be completely incongruous if we were to take the opposite position."The Premier League generated £3.3bn of revenue last season, according to a review by Deloitte, and boasts worldwide television contracts worth £8.3bn.The Leave camp have criticised Mr Scudamore's remarks.They argue Brexit could free up more funds to be invested in sports.Vote Leave's Robert Oxley said: "EU rules hurt both our ability to develop home grown talent and restrict access to the global talent pool."That's the worst of both worlds for football fans and the teams they support. If we take back control, we can spend the £350m we send to Brussels each week on our priorities, like grassroots sport."

Euro 2016 fans stranded as 300 migrants storm Calais chanting ‘F*** the UK’2016-06-21Roads approaching the Eurotunnel Shuttle and ferry terminals were turned into a warzone as French riot police fired tear gas in a desperate attempt to keep the mob at bay.England football fans were caught in the chaos as gangs of migrants blocked traffic in a bid to break into lorries bound for the UK.Eyewitnesses report the horde were throwing rocks at cars and chanting: “F*** the UK.”The incident comes just days before the EU referendum with immigration being a key battle ground ahead of the poll on Thursday.PHOTOSHOTPHOTOSHOTPHOTOSHOT“They are placing objects in the road and trying to get on trucks”Terrifying footage shows groups of men roaming free on the roads approaching the border.French authorities were forced to seal off the port as gangs from the nearby Jungle migrant camp targeted the Calais ring road in coordinated attacks.Several officers were injured as police set up fences.Just came through Calais and look at the thousands trying to get in������ frightening amount #Brexit #VoteLeave pic.twitter.com/eOg153IpGHIt's been stuck at #Calais for 12hrs.

EU referendum 2016: How Brexit will change your day-to-day life2016-06-24PABrexit is now certain after a majority of Brits voted to quit the EU.The nation will change forever but what impact would Brexit have on you, your family and friends?Brexit could be bad news for your weekly shop because the value of the pound is expected to drop.A weaker pound means more expensive imports, in turn pushing up the cost of food and booze such as French cheese and Italian wine.Brexiteers claim that being in the EU actually increases supermarket prices due to its “protectionist policies”.PABut future tariffs on food and drink exports would be up in the air because we don’t know what a post-Brexit trade deal would actually look like.If Britain fails to thrash out a free trade agreement, it would fall back on its World Trade Organization membership, which involves high EU tariffs for food.Holidaymakers would have to splash more cash on European holidays if Brexit leads to a fall in the value of the pound.Britons might also lose the right to compensation if flights are delayed and cancelled – something that is currently guaranteed under an EU regulation.They could be forced to give up access to free healthcare in Europe as well as financial protection for package holidays there.GettyIf Britain quits the EU, then it is thought that international footballers would be forced to get work visas in order to keep playing here.Under current visa rules, players like Dimitri Payet and N'Golo Kante would be barred from coming over as their international records wouldn’t meet FA criteria.The Remain camp has warned that Brexit would jeopardise the influx of European talent. But Brexiteers argue it could be good for home-grown rising stars.Leave supporters have pointed out that Premier League players already come to play in Britain from all over the world.GettyIt is extremely unlikely that expats living in Spain and other European countries would be expelled in the event of Brexit.But they could lose certain rights such as access to healthcare and benefits systems in their adopted homelands.A Government paper on Brexit warns there is no guarantee that Britons would keep the rights to work, reside, own property and use public services abroad.It says: “UK citizens resident abroad, among them those who have retired to Spain, would not be able to assume that these rights will be guaranteed.”At the moment you can hop on the ferry across to Calais to stock up on as much cut-price booze as you like.But leaving the EU could spell the end of cross-channel booze cruises to France, warns the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA).Victoria Bacon, of ABTA, says: “At the moment you can cross to continental Europe and buy as much booze as you want to bring home. In the event that we leave the EU, this will have to be renegotiated.“The negotiation process will take at least two years and this continuing uncertainty is bound to affect the value of the pound.”

Europe in meltdown: The Far Right set to rise up after shock Brexit win2016-06-24GETTYFar right leaders across Europe have hailed the historic referendum votes, calling it a victory for their own anti-EU and anti-immigrant positions.They have also pledged to push for similar votes in their own countries – something that could see the European Union collapse.France’s Front National (FN) Marine Le Pen, which is considered a very conservative party, told RTL radio this morning: “Like a lot of French people, I’m very happy that the British people held on and made the right choice."What we thought was impossible yesterday has now become possible."This morning, she also changed her Twitter profile picture to a Union Jack.TWITTERVICTORY ! #EUref #BrexitGETTYLe Pen's niece, Marion Maréchal Le Pen – one of the Front National’s two MPs – sent out a tweet calling the vote a "victory".Before polling stations had closed, Marine Le Pen was already prediciting a Brexit – even holding a Brit-French referendum party.Donald Trump, who recently became the U.S. Republican Party nominee for President called the result a "great thing", adding that the UK's residents have "taken back their country"He made the remarks as touched down at his Trump Turnberry golf resort in Scotland this morning.Ambiance franco-britannique pour célébrer la liberté des nations ! pic.twitter.com/A0rVVhno78Meanwhile, Geert Wilders of the right wing Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) released a statement congratulating Britain on "Independence Day".It said: "Britain points Europe the way to the future and to liberation. It is time for a new start, relying on our own strength and sovereignty. Also in the Netherlands."The Dutch people deserve a referendum as well. The Party for Freedom consequently demands a referendum on NExit, a Dutch EU exit."Wilders himself said: “We want be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders, and our own immigration policy."If I become prime minister, there will be a referendum in the Netherlands on leaving the European Union as well.

Time for a Dutch referendum! #ByeByeEUhttps://t.co/kXZ0aQtgmxMatteo Salvini, leader of Italy's Northern League Party, which is also considered far right, said of the result: “Hurrah for the courage of free citizens!

Migrant who walked through Chunnel free to live here – despite guilty plea2016-06-22GETTYSudanese migrant Abdul Rahman Haroun, 40, was granted permission to stay in Britain after being caught walking near the end of the tunnel on August 4 last year.Ahead of the trial at Canterbury Crown Court he changed his plea to guilty to "obstructing an engine or a carriage using a railway".A judge sentenced him to nine months in prison – but today he walked free because of time already served.PAThere are fears that – even before a possible Brexit from the EU – the Channel crossing is becoming as dangerous as the Med for migrants trying to cross.Twenty migrants were rescued off a boat in the sea by coastguards last month.The news comes after truck drivers told of their fears of another summer of migrant mayhem in Calais, France.Veteran driver Mick Young said the situation is “worse than ever before”.

Donald Trump backs Brexit, says David Cameron's resignation is 'too bad'2016-06-24“People are angry all over the world. They're angry over borders, they're angry over people coming into the country and taking over”The Republican presidential candidate arrived in his 'Trump' emblazoned helicopter at the Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire to officially open the revamped resort he bought in 2014.He arrived just an hour after Prime Minister David Cameron announced he will step down in October, following the UK's shocking decision to leave the European Union.Trump likened the success of the Leave campaign to his rise to promience in the United States.GETTYTrump also issued a statement on his facebook page praising the result.He wrote: "The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples. They have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy."A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense. The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration."FBCelebs have been reacting to the shocking result, with Lily Allen taking aim at Jeremy Hunt calling him an "insidious p****".The world is also begining to feel the impacts, as Spain demands joint ownership of Gibraltar after the Brexit vote and the far-right celebrate across Europe.Questions remain over what happens now the vote has gone through, and Nigel Farage admitted he could not guarantee EU cash would go the NHS.

EU Referendum: Peter Mandelson urges voters to 'reject Nigel Farage's false promises'2016-06-19GETTYIt’s a decision about our economy – whether we want to keep access to Europe’s crucial single market with a population of 500million people.Its common rules mean that selling a British product in Berlin is just as cheap and hassle-free as selling it in Birmingham.Three million British jobs are linked to this trade.GETTYIt’s also a decision about Britain’s role in the world – whether we want Britain to stay at the forefront of global decision making.“And who wants us to leave?

EU referendum: Footie stars may be booted out after Brexit vote, warns Premier League boss2016-06-22GETTYCurrently EU membership allows European stars to easily sign for Premier League teams.But Brexit could curb their freedom of movement – meaning some players will not automatically qualify for work permits.According to a study, 332 European players currently playing in the Premier League, Championship and Scottish Premiership would fail to meet the non-EU criteria if the UK quits the EU.GETTY“West Ham would have four players who would not automatically qualify for work permits should Britain vote to leave ”With latest polls indicating a slight lead for Brexit, Mr Gold tweeted his concern, pointing out: "West Ham would have four players who would not automatically qualify for work permits should Britain vote to leave the European Union."France's Euro hero so far Dimitri Payet along with Pedro Obiang, Angelo Ogbonna and goalkeeper Adrian are the four in question.Other teams that could be hit badly are Arsenal – who face losing eight players.They are Francis Coquelin, Mathieu Flamini, Mikel Arteta, Hector Bellerin, Nacho Monreal, Tomas Rosicky, Laurent Koscielny and Serge Gnabry.Manchester United would lose six players and Manchester City would see four struggling..Richard Scudamore, the executive chairman of the Premier League, said he was against leaving because the EU suited UK teams.He said: "There is an openness in the Premier League that is incongruous with leaving the EU."But Brian Monteith of the Leave.eu campaign argued Brexit would actually create more recruitment opportunities for clubs."The freedom of movement for people in the EU comes at the price of heavy restrictions on visas for potential signings from Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia," he told the BBC."Once we leave the EU, the UK will be free to treat footballers from all countries equally, which will broaden the pool of talent for our teams, not reduce it."Fears for British footie come as a host of celebs voice their opinions, showing they are as divided about Brexit as the rest of us.It is set to go the wire – don’t expect the bookies to payout much.Decision day is tomorrow and you will be able to cast your EU referendum vote at your local polling station between 7am and 10pm.There will be one question: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"Meanwhile sex-mad couples have elected to have a Brexit bonkathon, with an orgy of wife-swapping as the nation goes to the polls on the Brexit referendum.

Under-fire Jeremy Corbyn rejects calls to resign after Labour MPs blast EU efforts2016-06-24Britain has voted to the leave the European Union, Prime Minister David Cameron has resigned, and the chaos of the day after Brexit is taking hold.But despite the massive upheaval, with the pound plummeting and everyone asking 'what happens now?', the Labour Leader has said he is staying where he is.MPs are calling for their leader to step down after a "sneering" and passionless campaign to save Britain's place in Europe.Corbyn faces a vote of no confidence tabled by MPs Margaret Hodge and Ann Coffey, and there have been reports of an attempted coup during this morning's Shadow Cabinet meeting.The Labour leader has swiftly dismissed the motion as a "self-indulgent" act, but he has abandoned a scheduled appearance at the Glastonbury music festival.GETTYA source in the Labour party told Daily Star Online: "He should step down for someone who can better get Labour's message across."They added: "At times during the referendum campaign – like when he went on holiday – it felt like he was sneering at us."I put my heart and soul into this and so did actvists, but Jeremy didn't."Another senior source described the mood within the party as one of "utter devastation".It is understood the Labour rebels have enough votes to pass the motion of no confidence overwhelmingly.Dame Margaret urged Mr Corbyn to "do the decent thing" and stand down in the way the PM has."The European referendum was a test of leadership and I think Jeremy failed that test," she told Sky News."He came out too slowly, he was very half-hearted about his attempts to campaign and Labour voters simply didn't get the message."“I can't believe there's any attacks on me personally on a day like this”The Telegraph reported there is currently a backlash amongst MPs against the Labour leader.This comes after a leaked script showed the party was trying to position him as a "critical" figure in unifying Britain in the wake of the referendum.This morning Corbyn rejected reports that MPs are blaming him for the defeat.He said: "I can't believe there's any attacks on me personally on a day like this".Speaking to Sky News, the Labour leader said he was not going to quit – simply replying "no" when asked.He said: "We accept the result obviously. The country has been divided but has made a decision."We now have to organise how we leave the EU and crucially how we develop a strong economic relationship we Europe and other parts of the world as jobs rely on that."He added the country has an "urgent economic challenge to deal with".Later in the day the Labour leader elaborated further, telling Channel 4 News that he was "making the case for unity".He added: "I'm making the case of what Labour can offer to Britain, of decent housing for people, of good secure jobs for people, of trade with Europe and of course with other parts of the world."Because if we don't get the trade issue right we've got a real problem in this country."GETTYThe Huffington Post reports MPs feel that Corbyn made a mistake by stressing the benefits of immigration instead of focusing on workers' rights.A 'key member' of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign told the website: “Jeremy hasn’t pulled his weight. Even if we had won, it would have been despite not because of him.”An MP told HuffPost: “The EU referendum simply shone a light on how utterly out of touch Corbyn and McDonnell are with so many traditional Labour voters outside of London."Jeremy made the biggest issue of concern for traditional Labour voters thinking of voting Leave - ie the impact of freedom of movement - his almost sole reason why Britain should remain. It was a sort of political suicide of genius proportions."

Boris Johnson: Let’s free ourselves from Europe's shackles by voting OUT in the referendum2016-06-19GETTYWe will continue to be engaged with Europe; we will never cease to be a great European power, but you don’t have to do it through the institutions of the EU, which I think are very undemocratic.How I see it is that we have got four days left to save Europe.Unless we vote for change it will go on and on in a totally undemocratic way.This is our moment when the British people take centre stage in history, this is when the eyes of Europe are on us and I think hundreds of millions of people are praying we will do the right thing and vote for change because they are locked in a system incapable of change.GETTYI think if we do this we will be speaking up for democracy in Britain and in Europe and it will be a fine thing that will echo through the ages.It is four days to an independence day and until we speak up for freedom.As a country we love Europe; we love the European continent and civilisation; we will always be attached to it; we will always be friendly and supportive but we have got to stop being enmeshed in a bureaucratic and top down undemocratic system of government.I believe it is an unshackling of Britain.GETTYWe have now got four days to take those chains off.If this was a club and you were being asked to join now would you dream of doing it?The answer is no.So why stay in?Let’s get out and drive change.I think this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take back control from the unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable and unreformed EU.There is no time in our history when we have suffered by making our politics more accountable and more democratic and I hope that we seize this chance on Thursday to take Britain forward.GETTY“This is a moment when the British people should trust themselves ”This is a moment when the British people should trust themselves and should believe in this country’s democratic institutions and should back themselves.We can never go wrong by backing ourselves.The first thing to do is begin by repealing sections two and three of the European Communities Act 1972 so you reestablish the supremacy of Parliament.You can also begin work on an Australian-style points based immigration system which would be fair to people coming from all parts of the world – not just from the EU but also outside the EU as well.GETTYI don’t like extremism, I don’t like the far-right parties that you are seeing coming up across Europe.But I think the problem with immigration is politicians have promised they can control it when legally they can’t because we are in the EU.You can only spike the guns of the extremists if you take back control because I think it’s the public sense of the loss of control that is leading to so much disquiet.

EU migrants face uncertain future as Britain backs Brexit in EU referendum2016-06-24GETTYThere are some 3.3million non-British EU citizens living in the UK whose destiny now hangs in the balance.Some have speculated that, however rough the breakup, both sides will see the sense in sorting the rights of existing residents.Yet others, including Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, had warned of dire consequences ahead of the result.“British citizens would lose their right to move freely”David Cameron, who today announced his resignation as PM, tried to allay the fears of EU migrants currently in the UK.There would be no "immediate" changes for those living here or those Brits living in the EU, he announced.He said: "I would also reassure Britons living in European countries and European citizens living here there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances."There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold."GETTYBut Mr Rajoy, said more 100,000 Spaniards living and working in the UK would lose their right to be there.He added that some 400,000 British citizens living in Spain would also lose their right to stay in his country."It would be very negative for British citizens," he said. "The EU is based, ever since its foundation, on the principles of freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capitals."Leaving the EU would mean that British citizens would lose their right to move freely, work and do business within the largest economic area, the largest market in the world."UKIP leader Nigel Farage said legal EU migrants should have the right to remain in the UK back in 2014.And Lord Lawson, a former finance minister and prominent leave campaigner, said he would be able to continue living in France with just "some extra paperwork".Some have cited the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which is said to protect citizens' acquired rights even if the treaty that conferred them is annulled.When Greenland left an earlier version of the EU in 1985, the few foreign workers who were based there were protected by this agreement.However lawyers have highlighted that the convention refers to states' rights, rather than individuals' rights.According to the Economist, it is not actually mentioned in the Lisbon treaty, which sets out how countries leave the European Union.While France hasn't even signed the convention, meaning it affords no protection to Brits living in France or the French living in the UK.And a House of Commons report dismissed the precedent set by Greenland as "scarcely relevant".

'God backs Brexit' Outrage as vicar uses sermon to peddle EU views2016-06-19GETTYPaul Hedger told his congregation he would be voting to leave the EU on June 23.He added: “I believe God has told us to do this.“I do believe with all of my heart that God said you must do it. He said you must do it because as a church leader, as indeed as parents, whoever we are, silence is not an option.”The sermon preached last Sunday at Isleham High Street Church in Isleham, Cambs has created quite a stir.One angry parishioner walked out in protest.“God's house is not for campaigning. The decisions we make about political issues must be kept away from the church.”Others claim he was pushing his own political views but he defended his speech saying he had a responsibility to inform them of God's views.One churchgoer, who did not want to be named, said: "The congregation was shocked to hear the lead pastor openly campaign for the Brexit camp."We go to church to pray and serve God and not be told how to vote in matters that have nothing to do with God."God's house is not for campaigning. The decisions we make about political issues must be kept away from the church."A person's vote must be their sole decision without any influence from the man of the cloth."GETTYIn the sermon uploaded on the church’s website, Mr Hedger described the EU as anti-Christian.He said “one of the worst traits of the EU” is that it did not protect the rights of the couple who owned the bakery and refused to serve a gay couple.Mr Hedger added that EU claimed to protect religious freedom but then had amended it.He read: “Although the right of freedom to have religious belief is absolute under Article 9 ECHR. The right to manifest that belief is subject to the rights of others.“Why does religion has to submit? What they are saying is you can be a Christian as long as you are one secretly but you can’t express it.SGGOOGLEMAPSMr Hedger then likened the EU to an empire which seeks to dissolve cultures and mix religions.He said: “What is clear is that God loves nations but he takes a different view of empires.”He also attacked the statue outside of the EU’s headquarters which depicts the Greek God Zeus, who is celebrated for raping a girl.In the sermon, Mr Hedger admitted it was a "risky approach" to share his views but defended his actions.He said: "All of us would want God's perspective and as followers, once you have God's perspective we have a responsibility as Christians to see it through God's eyes."We have to ask ourselves, how would God see it?"Mr Hedger added: "I see it as the church's responsibility on issues that affect our lives to inform people."My aim with what I said was to help them see there may be a higher agenda above what politicians say."I would stand by everything I said and a lot of people from our church have been very supportive."

The Brexit. The British want to leave the EU - against the advice of almost all experts and against economic reason - and against the wishes of other Europeans."The result of the referendum is a shock. For Prime Minister David Cameron, for the majority of the political elite, for the economy - and for Europe. For the first time ever, a member country wants to leave the EU. It is a huge vote of no confidence and one that could find imitators. The future of the European Union is at stake."Experts fear the country is now headed for a recession. The whole political class in Westminster finds itself standing before enormously difficult times. After this defeat, Cameron will no longer be prime minister."SPIEGEL
