Our employees paid price of EU dream, admits Red Len: Union boss declares enlargement was 'gigantic experiment at the expense' of British workers2016-6-21Union baron Len McCluskey last night declared that the enlargement of the EU into Eastern Europe had been a ‘gigantic experiment’ conducted ‘at the expense’ of British workers.The leader of the country’s biggest union – supposed to be campaigning to stay inside the EU – said it had led to ‘sustained pressure on living standards, a systematic attempt to hold down wages and to cut the costs of social provision for working people’.His intervention came amid the publication of a report claiming that unskilled EU migrants cost each British family more than £200 a year.Union baron Len McCluskey, pictured, who last night declared that the enlargement of the EU into Eastern Europe had been a ‘gigantic experiment’ conducted ‘at the expense’ of British workersBenefit handouts, the cost of education and healthcare bills bump up the amount paid by taxpayers to almost £6.6billion a year, the report said.Mr McCluskey – known as Red Len – delivered a devastating verdict on the decision to allow workers from Eastern Europe into the EU from 2004.If Britain votes to stay inside the EU, the free movement of workers will continue unchecked. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, an ally of Mr McCluskey, has said this makes it impossible to put an upper limit on immigration.Writing in the Guardian, Mr McCluskey said: ‘In the last ten years, there has been a gigantic experiment at the expense of ordinary workers. Countries with vast historical differences in wage rates and living standards have been brought together in a common labour market.Jeremy Corbyn admitting he is not a lover of the EU during a Sky News debateJeremy Corbyn last night admitted he was ‘not a lover of the EU’ as he struggled to explain why Britain should vote Remain.In a question-and-answer session on Sky News, the Labour leader, left, also praised Germany’s open-door policy for migrants and refugees, which Angela Merkel has had to abandon.Lifelong Eurosceptic Mr Corbyn, who is backing Remain following Shadow Cabinet pressure, said he fully supported the EU’s principle of free movement, which is blamed for driving many Labour voters to back Brexit.But he hit out at EU policies on trade, competition and austerity, saying he was ‘not unconditional about Europe by any means’.Mr Corbyn also criticised ‘catastrophist’ warnings from the In campaign, and said he was backing Remain in the hope that the European Union would change and strengthen workers’ rights.He said: ‘I’m not a lover of the European Union, I think it’s a rational decision, we should stay in order to try and improve.’And Mr Corbyn, whose lack of enthusiasm for the EU has angered party colleagues, said he would not be held responsible for a Brexit vote. ‘I’m not going to take blame for people’s decisions,’ he said.‘The result has been sustained pressure on living standards, a systematic attempt to hold down wages and to cut costs of social provision for working people.’His comments will heighten fears that working-class Labour supporters will fail to turn out on Thursday – or vote for Leave.However, Mr McCluskey said he did not agree that leaving the EU would halt ‘the supply of cheap labour coming to Britain’.The group of eight independent leading economists published the paper as the EU referendum campaign entered its final days. It says the influx from Eastern Europe and elsewhere into low-skilled jobs has led to a heavier burden on communities.The organisation also cites a paper published by the Bank of England which found mass migration had driven down wages of millions of Britons. But it said that skilled migrants offered a ‘huge economic boost’.Economists For Brexit analysed the total taxation contribution of the 1.2million EU migrants in the UK considered unskilled and compared it with the cost in welfare payments and use of the NHS and education. It calculated that a family of four EU migrants, with two children at primary school and a stay-at-home mother, would pay £1,271 in tax and national insurance a year, but cost £30,496 in handouts, schools and healthcare – a net cost of £29,225.Meanwhile, a single EU foreigner would rake in £2,120 a year in benefits but pay out £1,271 – a net cost of £849 per annum.The think-tank, assisted by former University of Liverpool tax and benefits expert Paul Ashton, calculated single people would make up 28 per cent of the 1.2million unskilled migrants.This gave the cost of single migrants as £288.6million, while for families it was £6.28billion – a total of almost £6.6billion. The cost to the taxpayer was £17.75 a month for each worker, or £213 a year. Patrick Minford, co-chairman of the think-tank and a professor of economics at Cardiff University, said: ‘Skilled migrants offer a huge economic boost to the UK... 'However, it is clear that the UK is suffering in economic terms significantly from vast numbers of unskilled EU migrants. Leaving the EU and the single market is the only way for the UK to take back control.’But Labour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said experts ‘all now agree that leaving would damage the UK economy.’Meanwhile, former Tory Treasury minister Peter Lilley has attacked George Osborne’s analysis that the cost of leaving the EU would devastate British trade – calling it ‘indefensible statistical manipulation’.Schools bulging at seams squeeze in extra classes to cop with influxBy Sarah HarrisLeave campaigner Priti Patel says the pressure on schools shows how uncontrolled immigration is affecting public servicesTens of thousands of pupils are being squeezed into extra primary school classes amid high migration and a baby boom.Schools are being forced to provide ‘bulge’ classes or permanently increase intakes due to the unprecedented pressure on places.Data issued under freedom of information laws shows that in 47 English council areas, more than 732 primary schools have added an extra or bulge class in the past five years.These one-off classes equate to an extra 21,960 pupils on school rolls. They usually start in reception and continue through the years until the pupils reach secondary age.Another 418 primary schools have permanently increased their admission total to add one or more additional forms.If the pattern is repeated across England, it would mean a total of 2,432 bulge classes, cramming more than 72,960 extra pupils into schools. It would also equate to 1,368 primaries being forced to permanently add forms.The problem has become a battleground in the EU referendum debate. Leave campaigners argue that the increased demand is fuelled by immigration and will only get worse if the UK votes to remain.The FOI figures show most bulge classes and expansions are focused in areas with high migration, including London, the South East and East of England, and the Midlands.In Essex, 86 primaries have bulge classes while Kent has 57. In Hounslow, West London, 30 schools have taken at least one new class and 24 have permanently expanded. Barnet, North London, has 51 bulge classes and Bromley, South London, has 22. In Derbyshire, 43 primaries have new classes and Lincolnshire schools have squeezed in 30.Some have doubled in size. Maney Hill in Birmingham, Mellers Primary in Nottingham, and Hogarth Primary in Brentford, West London, will go from 210-pupil primaries to 420.Leave campaigner and Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘The shortage of places is another example of how uncontrolled migration is putting unsustainable pressures on public services.’Schools minister Nick Gibb warned against a Leave vote, saying: ‘By building a stronger economy, we will deliver 600,000 more places over the next five years.’ 

Bienvenue à Londres: That's what Boris always said to French, reveals his former mayoral adviser GUTO HARRI. So why on earth has he changed his EU tune?2016-6-19I count myself as one of Boris Johnson’s greatest admirers.I watched him closely as his spokesman and director of communications in his first four years at City Hall. My office was next to his. My wife moaned that there were three people in our marriage, ‘and the blonde always seems to come ahead of me!’When Francois Hollande promised punitive taxes on high earners in Paris, Boris issued an open invitation to them, declaring: ‘Bienvenue à Londres.’ Many took up the invitation and are still here, paying UK taxesI’ve seen how his magic touch resonates as powerfully in Chelsea as in the East End. I’ve been handed thousands of smartphones to snap Boris selfies for the fans.He travelled everywhere without a driver or security. No one ever hurt Boris, but he was often greeted with a heartfelt ‘Tory Tosser’, a badge of honour as he saw it.As we cycled to Westminster together one day, we happened to pull up at traffic lights next to David Cameron’s limo. ‘Aren’t you the Mayor of London?’, shouted another cyclist. ‘Yes, I guess I am.’Then he spotted the face in the car.’ Isn’t he the leader of the Opposition?’ ‘Yes’, says Boris, ‘we’re the outriders!’ It was less amusing when staff rang to say they had caught a man trying to smuggle a gun in to attack the Mayor. Fortunately, he was apprehended.What happened to Jo Cox was tragic. Politics, if it is worth doing, involves taking a stand that some will disagree with, and the tributes to the MP from across the divide remind us of the universal respect for those who champion a worthy cause and speak plainly.So I respect my former boss for taking sides in the referendum debate. Sadly – in my view – he picked the wrong side. How can this Brussels-educated, multilingual, half-Turkish, quarter-French, Catholic-christened former Mayor even contemplate London, let alone Britain, leaving the EU, asks Guto HarriOn the day reporters were camped outside his house waiting to discover whether he would back Leave or Remain, I was trying to talk him back from the brink, arguing that Brexit would cast the UK adrift. I failed.The reason I struggle to understand his decision is because of my experience of working alongside him. As Mayor, Boris was a passionate champion for London. He’s always hated those who ‘talk London down,’ and once frustrated US TV interviewer Katie Couric by being too positive about London during the worst days of the financial crisis. Stopping the interview, she told him: ‘You’re coming across as a recession-denier.’ ‘That’s my job,’ he said. ‘Start the camera again.’ Those were the days when he took the courageous and counter-intuitive decision to support the financial sector at a time when most of the world wanted to string up bankers.Guto Harri (above): 'I respect my former boss for taking sides in the referendum debate. Sadly – in my view – he picked the wrong side'I heard him describe bankers in terms that would make many blush. But he was also clear about their contribution to the capital. Behind every top finance chief is a food chain that stretches from the corporate lawyer, accountant and PR to the driver, shop assistant, sous chef and nanny, he would argue – as well as a stripper, he would occasionally add.I was there when Boris argued for a fall in the top rate of tax so London would not lose its competitive advantage over fierce rivals for flows of capital and high net-worth individuals.When Francois Hollande promised punitive taxes on high earners in Paris, Boris issued an open invitation to them, declaring: ‘Bienvenue à Londres.’ Many took up the invitation and are still here, paying UK taxes.And I helped him lobby the EU to modify proposals for an Alternative Investment Directive that would have undermined the City he was so determined to protect. The directive was modified, London pulled through the recession and the mass hysteria against bankers burnt itself out.Yet now Boris would cut London adrift from the EU. Short of a devastating terrorist attack, I cannot imagine any action more damaging to the City of London than Brexit. As a distinguished historian he understands the wider context of the referendum debate. His book, The Dream Of Rome, explored how the Romans achieved political and cultural unity in Europe. His biography of Churchill reflects on his post-war vision of peace between warring nations. And his Life Of London champions the enormous benefits to the capital of centuries of immigration.As Mayor, he opposed David Cameron’s immigration cap, advocated an amnesty for illegal immigrants, held citizenship ceremonies at City Hall and boasted how every visiting athlete would play to a home crowd at the London Olympics.For all its flaws, the EU has anchored Europe in democratic government and given us access to a market of 500 million on our doorstep. Just five years ago Boris wrote a newspaper article advocating an EU Services directive which, as he put it, ‘would allow everyone from opticians to estate agents to insurance brokers to set up more freely in other European jurisdictions’.The ultimate test – as he saw it – was to produce a common standard for electric plugs – a ‘Europlug’, he called it. ‘Now is the time to set out a positive vision for a Europe that actually helps individuals and businesses,’ he wrote.Which is why I struggle to comprehend how this Brussels-educated, multilingual, half-Turkish, quarter-French, Catholic-christened former Mayor can even contemplate London, let alone Britain, leaving the EU.

Charity fund in memory of murdered MP Jo Cox soars past £1million as public donate in memory of the tireless campaigner2016-6-20A charity fund in memory of murdered politician Jo Cox has soared past £1million as tens of thousands of well-wishers donated in memory of the tireless campaigner.The fundraising page for the Batley and Spen MP, who was stabbed and shot to death on the street four days ago in Birstall, West Yorkshire, has become GoFundMe's biggest UK campaign to date.Standing at more than £1million this evening, the donation page was set up by friends of the mother-of-two just after her tragic death, and the funds will be split between three charities.Up and up: The fundraising page for the Batley and Spen MP, who was stabbed and shot to death on the street four days ago in Birstall, West Yorkshire, has become GoFundMe's biggest UK campaign to dateTributes: A sea of flowers placed at a memorial in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where Labour MP Jo Cox was shot and stabbed to death in the street outside her constituency advice surgery last ThursdayLooking on: Flowers were placed around the statue of Joseph Priestley, the theologian who discovered oxygenChosen by her family, these are The Royal Voluntary Service, anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate and Syria-based volunteer search and rescue organisation The White Helmets. The fund was pushed past the seven-figure mark by a £6,000 donation from a 'David Newton'.Mrs Cox's friend Tim Dixon, one of those who launched the fund, said: 'The scale and speed of the public response to this fund has been overwhelming and deeply gratifying to Jo's family.'It shows how powerfully Jo's story has moved so many. Jo would be so proud.' Mrs Cox's husband Brendan tweeted tonight: 'Thank you to everyone for your incredible generosity. This will change lives in Syria, Batley and across the UK.'A GoFundMe spokesman said: 'We were saddened to hear about the tragic death of Jo Cox.'It's amazing to see how many people have come together to raise money for the charity's closest to Jo's heart in her memory. Our thoughts are with her family at this incredibly difficult time.'A statement from Mrs Cox's friends and family, who set up the page, said they were 'overwhelmed by everyone's incredible generosity and so grateful for all your donations'.Last week, a campaign raising money for the victims of the Pulse shooting in Orlando raised over $5million (£3.4million), in five days making it the largest and fastest crowd-funding appeal ever.It comes amid an outpouring of grief as politicians returned to Parliament to pay tribute to Mrs Cox and the man charged with her murder appeared in a London court for a bail hearing this afternoon.Memorial: Flowers are laid by members of the Jammu Kashmir National Awami Party in Birstall this morningFlowers in Birstall: The tributes today come amid an outpouring of grief in Britain and many other countriesThe Commons was recalled to allow MPs to honour their colleague as David Cameron spoke of the sadness Britain felt at the killing of the 'loving, determined, passionate and progressive politician'.The man accused of Mrs Cox's killing, Thomas Mair, 52, appeared at the Old Bailey as he was brought before a senior judge under the 'terrorism protocol'. He is charged with murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon. Labour politician: Married Mrs Cox had two young children and was the MP for Batley and SpenAlso today, Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused David Cameron and the Remain campaign of a 'despicable' attempt to create a link between the EU referendum and the death of Mrs Cox to improve their chances of winning Thursday's referendum.Mr Farage said Remain were 'scared witless' about the prospect of defeat on June 23 and were trying to 'conflate' the motivations of the Labour MP's alleged killer with those of the millions of voters who want to leave the EU.Mr Cameron has faced criticism from some quarters for retweeting a link to the last article written by Mrs Cox, in which she argued that Britain could deal with the issue of immigration more effectively by remaining in the EU.MPs are also set to meet police and parliamentary authorities today to discuss their security in the wake of the death of Mrs Cox.Home Secretary Theresa May will co-chair the meeting, where representatives of the Metropolitan Police and Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will answer questions from MPs.Meanwhile, calls are growing for the pensioner who tried to save MP Jo Cox to be officially honoured for his bravery.Bernard Kenny, 77, was stabbed in the stomach as he came to the aid of Mrs Cox when she was attacked outside the library on Thursday. He is recovering in hospital.Mr Kenny is said to be a former miner who was part of the rescue teams which helped at the Lofthouse Colliery disaster in 1973. Seven men died when part of the now-closed pit flooded.An online petition has been set up calling on the Government to award Mr Kenny the George Cross - the highest bravery honour that can be given to non-military personnel.Separately, the charity Oxfam said today that Mrs Cox will be honoured with an album of live music from the Glastonbury Festival which will raise money for refugees.A poignant video emerged today of MP Jo Cox at a fish and chip shop lending her support to an 18-year-old girl she was campaigning on behalf of to be recognised as Britain's youngest frier.In what is thought to be Mrs Cox's last ever appearance on video, she visits Heckmondwike's Yorkshire Chippy, which claims to be Britain's first gluten-free-only fish and chip shop.Founder and director Jad Choudhury, 31, released two videos to MailOnline of Mrs Cox's visit on Thursday, June 9, speaking during what is believed to be her last trip to a business.He said how Mrs Cox was going to write a letter to get the shop's frier Paige Ramsden recognised as Britain's youngest frier – and she lends her support to Paige Ramsden in the video clip.Mrs Cox says: 'Hi there, I'm Jo Cox MP, member of parliament for Batley and Spen, and I'm here at Yorkshire's gluten free chippy with Paige, the amazing Paige, who we think might well be our country's youngest frier, is that right Paige? And who are you?Miss Ramsden then responds by saying: 'Well. I'm Paige, I'm 18, and I'm a frier at Yorkshire Chippy, the first gluten free fish and chip shop in history.'Mrs Cox then continues: 'Brilliant, so come along down and enjoy the fish and chips.'In another clip for the business, she says: 'Hi, I'm Jo Cox MP, member of parliament for Batley and Spen, and I'm just about to tuck into an amazing gluten free fish and chips package down here.'History has been made here in Heckmondwike. We've got the first in history gluten free chippy, right here in Heckmondwike in Yorkshire. So do come along, and really these are amazing chips and brilliant fish. Come and join me.'Mr Choudhury said: 'Her last visit to a business was us. She came down because she's been part of the business from the planning - she really wanted to put Heckmondwike on the map.'We're the first ever gluten free fish and shop chop. Before I even started the business I got in touch with her. She's really keen to support the business. We've only been going since March.Appearance:  Mrs Cox tweeted a photo of her visit to Heckmondwike's Yorkshire Chippy with its manager Tracy Smylie (left), 18-year-old frier Paige Ramsden (centre) and server Lindsay Broadley (right)'She came down last week to try our fish and chips. She was supposed to come back to us this week with her family to have fish and chips with her family. It's tragic.'She had a heart of gold. She was very friendly, very bubble, she treated everyone equally, she had no ego. She took her time to speak to everyone here and she was just loyal.'Asked why he started the shop, he said: 'To support the coeliacs out there. Coeliacs always pay a premium to eat out - but we wanted to provide an equal opportunity where they can eat fish and chips.'It's much better (than normal fish and chips), it's more organic. Even on TripAdvisor we've been getting five stars - even from people who are non-coeliacs. We're a fish and chip shop with a twist.'Jo was going to write a letter to get her (Miss Ramsden) recognised as Britain's youngest frier.'

'I did all I could': Jeremy Corbyn confronts angry Labour activists calling for him to quit over lacklustre Remain campaign 2016-6-24Jeremy Corbyn has claimed he did 'all he could' to prevent the UK leaving the EU as pressure mounts on him to resign. Today angry activists criticised him for 'failing to get working class votes' after dozens of typical Labour heartlands in the north and Wales voted for Leave.And the embattled Labour leader, who was attending London's Pride festival, was criticised for 'using the LGBTQ community' to 'protect his leadership'. But Mr Corbyn defended his Brexit campaign record and told activists that 'I did all I could'.Labour's John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, went as far as saying Mr Corbyn, 67, 'worked himself to the ground' despite many on the right and left criticising him for a 'lacklustre' effort.Scroll down for videoMr Corbyn was vocally attacked by Labour activists as he took part in Gay Pride in London todayLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn made no comment on his own future as Labour leader today despite an attempt to oust him with a no confidence motion Mr Corbyn attempted to get back on the front foot earlier today with a major speech on immigration, blasting an 'irresponsible' debate during the campaign and demanding the Government focus more on the public's worries about how migrants impact on public services.As many as 200 Labour MPs are expected to back a no confidence motion in Mr Corbyn if it is called to a secret ballot on Tuesday.But asked today if he would contest any leadership contest that follows, Mr Corbyn told Sky News: 'Yes. I'm here.'  Labour MP Frank Field today claimed Mr Corbyn should recognise he cannot return Labour to power and quit for the good of the party.  In his speech, the Labour leader insisted the concerns about immigration and its impact on public services and housing.He said: 'We have to address the needs of people and places that have been left behind, building an economic strategy that works for all, in all parts of the country''And we have to move beyond the irresponsible debate that we sometimes have that makes people afraid or that accuses people of being Little Englanders or racists just for raising the issue.'It is clear from the vote on Thursday and from the people I have spoken to across Britain … that there was a backlash against the free movement of people across the 28 nations in the European Union.' Labour leader Mr Corbyn tried to get back on the front foot today after the shock Brexit vote with a speech on immigration Mr Corbyn insisted he was elected as Labour leader 'to redistribute power and wealth in this country' but otherwise did not address his own role.He said: 'Inequality is the issue of our times and we must face it and act decisively against it.'We must talk about immigration but we will never pander to prejudice.'So, as we begin in the coming weeks and months … to negotiate – in all its complexity – our exit from the European Union we must also debate the Britain we want that will be shaped by how that exit takes place.' Brexit backer Mr Field praised the Labour leader for focusing on public frustrations with the impact of globalisation but said his pitch was tainted by 'serious claptrap' in other areas.Labour MP Frank Field today called for Mr Corbyn to resign for the good of the party The embattled Opposition leader has rejected calls for his resignation amid growing fury at his failure to galvanise the party's traditional supporters to turn out in favour of EU membership.There is alarm within the party at the way a series of traditional Labour strongholds in the North and Midlands voted heavily for Leave, with many voters citing concerns about immigration.Mr Corbyn is facing a vote of no confidence from some of his MPs, as many express concern at the possibility of him leading the party into a snap autumn general election.Mr Field had said Mr Corbyn should use today's speech to follow Mr Cameron and announce his departure.'One of the dilemmas that we have is that Jeremy is the only senior politician who has tried to grapple with and put forward views of that group of the electorate who are the losers by globalisation,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today.'Jeremy's problems are that he packages this with serious claptrap. For example our defence policy that we will have Trident, we will renew Trident but of course we won't have any weapons, has our supporters and probably the rest of the country lying down on the floor and yelling with rage or just simply crying'We are into an era of new politics where those people who have lost out clearly by globalisation, for the first time have found their voice through the referendum to saying in this country 'enough is enough'.'What Jeremy has been trying to do, with his social justice programme, is begin to answer those questions that are posed by the losers of globalisation but he clearly isn't the right person to actually lead the party into an election because nobody thinks he will actually win.'I would very much like him to do that and set the debate going with that kind of flavour.'Within hours of the referendum result, Labour MPs launched their plot to oust Mr Corbyn next week over his 'abysmal' performance in the EU referendum campaign.Furious MPs said Mr Corbyn 'had to take his share of responsibility' for the referendum result, which saw huge numbers of voters in Labour heartlands back Brexit.Last night Mr Corbyn indicated he will try to brazen it out, telling Channel 4 News: 'I will not resign.' He will attempt to get on the front foot today with a speech on immigration in London.Furious MPs said Jeremy Corbyn 'had to take his share of responsibility' for the referendum result, which saw huge numbers of voters in Labour heartlands back BrexitBut Labour grandee Dame Margaret Hodge and backbencher Ann Coffey tabled a formal motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn yesterday. Last night ten MPs had signed it.Scores of other Labour figures publicly criticised Mr Corbyn, and some sources believe close to 200 of the party's 232 MPs may back the motion when they vote on it in a secret ballot next week.Dame Margaret said: 'The referendum was a test of leadership and I think Jeremy failed that test. He came out too slowly, he was very half-hearted about his attempts to campaign and Labour voters simply didn't get the message.'The motion has no legal force under Labour's rules, but some Labour MPs say it would be 'untenable' for Mr Corbyn to cling on if he faces a public vote of no confidence from his own MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn described the attempted coup as 'self-indulgent', pointing out the Labour leader was given a huge mandate when he was elected less than a year ago.But there were signs they were taking the threat seriously, with Mr Corbyn pulling out of a planned appearance tomorrow at Glastonbury Festival. A spokesman said: 'He is focusing on the immediate issues from the EU vote.'Mr Corbyn, a lifelong Eurosceptic, struggled to make a convincing case for Remain and was yesterday spotted laughing with aides over breakfast in the Commons in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Hodge and backbencher Ann Coffey tabled a formal motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn yesterday. Last night ten MPs had signed itFormer Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said: 'This was a catastrophic defeat. I think Jeremy is a decent man but his leadership, or rather lack of it, particularly during the referendum campaign, has been abysmal. A motion of no confidence has been tabled against Jeremy Corbyn to be heard by the party next week. If accepted, it will be voted on Tuesday, when as many as 200 MPs could vote against Mr Corbyn.However, the motion has no legal force, and Mr Corbyn's allies last night indicated he would try to brazen it out – leading Labour MPs to search for an alternative way to oust their leader.The rules for removing a Labour leader are largely untested and designed to make it difficult for potential pretenders to seize the crown. Anyone wanting to mount a formal leadership challenge needs the public support of 51 Labour MPs and MEPs to trigger a contest.Some MPs believe they could easily gather the names needed. But they are not united around a single candidate, and many fear Mr Corbyn would automatically be placed on the ballot paper – meaning his army of activists may well re-elect him.'Like David Cameron, he needs to shoulder his share of the responsibility and ... step down.'Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said he 'would need an awful lot of persuading to have confidence in Jeremy's leadership going into a general election', while MP Graham Jones said: 'I want a damn good explanation from Jeremy Corbyn as to why we ended up in this mess. If I am not satisfied, I will support the motion.'Tony Blair said Mr Corbyn was 'pretty lukewarm' about staying in the EU while Peter Mandelson said he 'seemed to be travelling through the entire referendum with a handbrake on'. Ex-spin chief Alastair Campbell and Labour's former energy spokesman Caroline Flint both said Mr Corbyn had failed to connect with the voters they lost.Stephen Kinnock, a prominent Remain supporter, also indicated he is prepared to vote for the motion.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell, one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies, said the Labour leader has 'overwhelming support' among grassroots activists. In a major boost last night, more than 80,000 activists signed a petition supporting Mr Corbyn and 12 of Britain's biggest unions – including Unite, Unison and the GMB – backed the Labour leader. They said: 'The last thing Labour needs is a manufactured leadership row in the midst of this crisis.'Now it's Project Spite from EU cheerleadersThe fiercely pro-EU Left-wing establishment reacted with bitterness and disbelief yesterday following the dramatic vote for Leave:PETER MANDELSONFormer EU Commissioner and business secretary Lord Mandelson said it was 'the worst day in post war British history'.The former MP for Hartlepool said that people in the North East 'were sold this ridiculous notion that coming out of the European Union was some sort of 'magic bullet' to solve all our country's problems with immigration'.Former business secretary Lord Mandelson said it was 'the worst day in post war British history''You should've looked really at the small print of what the Leave people were saying,' Lord Mandelson added. 'They didn't have one shred of an idea, not one single policy that explained how immigration would be changed if we came out of the European Union … I really regret we were not more successful in countering that ridiculous, fantasy politics and propaganda that spewed out of the Leave campaign.'TONY BLAIRThe strongly pro-EU former prime minister said Brexit made him 'sad for our country, for Europe, for the world'. He also said the Labour leadership was 'pretty lukewarm in its support for Remain' and had failed to show its supporters the 'enormous consequences' of a Leave vote and to help them 'understand that this was not a protest vote against the Government'.'The answers to the challenges of globalisation do not lie in shutting ourselves off from the world,' he said in an interview with Sky News.'I think what we will learn in these days, weeks and months ahead is that you can ride the anger through these populist movements but you don't actually produce the answers to the challenges people face ... We will find that what people thought was going to be an answer to these problems is not an answer at all.'The strongly pro-EU former prime minister said Brexit made him 'sad for our country, for Europe, for the world'KEITH VAZLabour MP for Leicester East and former Europe minister Keith Vaz said the result was a 'catastrophe'. He told the BBC: 'Frankly, in a thousand years I would never have believed that the British people would have voted this way.'And they have done so and I think that they voted emotionally rather than looking at the facts. It'll be catastrophic for our country, for the rest of Europe and indeed the world.'He added: 'The issues of immigration are extremely important, if you look at the campaign I think that there needed to be a much stronger campaign to stay in.'ALASTAIR CAMPBELLThe former Labour spin doctor said Britain is now in 'uncharted territory' and warned the break-up of the UK will follow.'One of the so-called Project Fear arguments that we kept trying to get over in this campaign is that there were incredible possible unintended consequences of a vote to leave the European Union,' he said. 'One is the break-up of the United Kingdom, I think we are looking at that.'He told ITV News: 'We saw what happened in Scotland and I think we are now seeing something similar in parts of the North of England. I think the whole question of the union now comes into view.'Former spin doctor Alistair Campbell warned of the unintended consequences of Brexit, including the break up of the United KingdomPOLLY TOYNBEEThe Guardian columnist said: 'What dark place does Britain for the British take us to? Catastrophe. Britain has broken apart.'An uprising of resentment by the left-behind has torn us in two, a country wrecked by a yawning class divide stretched wider by recession and austerity. Anger against a London establishment was deftly diverted by the Tory right and Ukip towards foreigners – enemies in Brussels and aliens in our midst.'She added: ' 'Controlling our borders', [Brexit voters] will expect immigrants, new and old, to be gone. They were told more housing, GP appointments and school places would be freed up from migrants. But as treasury receipts fall, there will be less of everything. Will the next call be to expel foreigners already here? What dark place does Britain for the British take us to?'EMILY THORNBERRY 'It won't be people like Boris Johnson who suffer, but those whose heads are only just above water,' said the Islington South MP.Miss Thornberry, who was forced to resign from Ed Miliband's shadow Cabinet for a 'sneering' post on Twitter of a house in Rochester with England flags and a white van outside, added: 'A lot of people in Islington depend on our country's internationalism. To leave will simply be dreadful and the Islington vote recognises that.' Islington overwhelmingly voted to stay in the EU, with 76,420 remain votes to 25,180 for leave.

'You're a 21st Century Neville Chamberlain!' Cameron mocked for appeasing EU leaders as he is hammered AGAIN by voters over his failure to tackle immigration2016-6-19David Cameron was hammered by voters over his failure to tackle immigration last night as he pleaded with them not to sacrifice the economy by leaving the EU.The Prime Minister was told by one woman that public services were at risk of being 'flooded' by levels of inflows, while a man compared him to Neville Chamberlain for appeasing other EU leaders during his renegotiation bid. He was also accused of 'shameful' scaremongering during the referendum campaign - and refused three times to say that he would deploy Britain's veto to prevent Turkey joining the EU.But Mr Cameron insisted there was no 'silver bullet' to bring down numbers and cutting ties with Brussels would severely damage UK plc.The brutal exchanges came as he appeared in his last big television set-piece before the nation goes to the polls on Thursday.David Cameron was involved in the brutal exchanges came as he appeared on a BBC Question Time special with just days to go until the nation goes to the pollsDuring the 45-minute BBC Question Time special, which took place as campaigning resumed after being put on hold in the aftermath of the fatal attack on pro-EU MP Jo Cox, Mr Cameron:A string of polls have shown a surge for the pro-EU camp over recent days.Research by Survation for The Mail On Sunday found Remain had opened up a three-point lead on 45 per cent to 42 per cent - reversing the firm's findings from Thursday.Another showed the two sides are level while a third has voters saying they are more enthusiastic about leaving the EU than staying.Pollsters have suggested that the apparent boost for Remain is down to undecided voters plumping for the status quo as the crucial ballot looms.But there has also been some criticism that pro-EU campaigners are trying to make capital out of the killing of Mrs Cox. One audience member warned the PM that immigration was threatening to 'flood' public services Mr Cameron - who today used his Twitter feed to highlight a article praising ties with Brussels that was written by Mrs Cox days before her death - urged voters to defend her 'values'. 'First of all let me say how shocked I think the whole country's been by this appalling murder,' he said.'Two children have lost their mother and a loving husband has lost his wife and my heart breaks when I think of them and what they're going through.'I think the most important thing for the politicians is to remember what she was all about, which was service, community, tolerance – these are values we should all try to live by and promote in order to remember her.'I don't think we know why exactly this happened or what the motivation was or the rest of it and we have to wait until the police investigation until we do that. 'But I think what we do know is wherever we see intolerance, hatred, division, we should try to drive it out of our communities, out of our public life and we have to be careful that debates – yes they can be passionate – but we have to make sure they're not based on those things.'One man took Mr Cameron to task over the way he had 'appeased' fellow EU leaders during his renegotiationDavid Cameron was hammered by voters over his failure to tackle immigration last night as he pleaded with them not to sacrifice the economy by leaving the EUDavid Dimbleby was chairing the BBC referendum programme with Mr Cameron last nightMr Cameron took the opportunity to hit out at Nigel Farage over his controversial poster depicting male Syrian refugees on the Slovenian border amid the refugee crisis last October.The Ukip leader today dismissed criticism of the poster, which has come from both sides of the debate, and insisted it had only triggered such a 'row' because of Mrs Cox's death.But Mr Cameron said: 'To be frank I think there have been some moments like the Nigel Farage poster which I think are just wrong – wrong in fact because it's a picture of people in the European continent from Syria and elsewhere, they're not coming to Britain.'But actually wrong in motivation because it's an attempt to frighten people, to scare them, to divide people.' The Prime Minister dismissed claims his own campaign had been scaremongering and 'sour'.'I would say that there's nothing more positive than trying to have a growing economy and having jobs and opportunities which is what the case for remain is all about,' he said.Audience members berated Mr Cameron for the way the campaign had been conducted, with one woman saying 'both sides' should be 'ashamed of how they behaved'.He was also mauled over his failure to tackle immigration - with net numbers currently running at a near-record 333,000 a year including 184,000 from the EU.The Prime Minister was told that public services were at risk of being 'flooded' by levels of inflows, while audience members laughed at his claims that other EU states could be trusted not to renege on commitments to reform Mr Cameron, who had pledged to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' before entering Downing Street, was challenged by a young woman in the audience who told him: 'I think that it's an only logical thing to understand that if we have absolutely no limitations on immigration from the EU that people are obviously going to immigrate over here.David Dimbleby shocked viewers with his gaffe on Question Time last nightDavid Dimbleby shocked the Question Time audience after mistakenly saying the first question of the debate came from an audience member called 'Jo Cox'.The veteran presenter immediately apologised for the 'terrible' gaffe' and called the correct audience member, who asked David Cameron about the late Labour MP tragically killed on Thursday.Introducing the opening question, Mr Dimbleby said: 'Right Prime Minister, our first question comes from Jo Cox please, oh sorry, Adam Bardy, what a terrible thing to say.'After the broadcaster's embarrassing gaffe, Mr Bardy asked: 'Has this referendum soured the political debate in this country in the light of the murder of Jo Cox?' Mr Dimbleby received sympathy from TV viewers on Twitter, however, with David Bulls saying he must be 'mortified for that slip about Jo Cox'.  'We've got our public sector, we've got NHS that's under tremendous strain at the moment – you're not doing anything to invest any kind of thing into them to make them any stronger or better - knowing full well that if we don't put a limit on this immigration - and the only way to do that is to leave the single market - then everything is just going to get flooded.'You're not doing anything to counterbalance all the immigration coming into these services.'The Prime Minister replied by insisting the only way of sustaining funding on the NHS was to have a strong economy by staying in the EU.Pointing out the views of professional bodies in the NHS, Mr Cameron said: 'What I'd say is, let's take the health service. What I'd say is that we are putting more money into the NHS. 'Now we can argue we should put even more in, let's work how to get the growth in our economy into the NHS.'But when you listen to the people in the NHS – the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Physicians, the guy Simon Stephens who runs the NHS, the trade unions who work in the NHS – they all want us to remain in a reformed European Union because they think that's better for the NHS because a bigger economy, a better economy, a stronger economy is always better for our NHS.'However he was interrupted by the audience member, who shot back: 'But you keep saying this reformed European Union that we are part of. Yes, fair enough you've negotiated some changes that you say 'oh it's going to make a massive difference to the immigration'.'But realistically it's not, it's not going to make a massive difference to the levels of immigration, especially considering we have other countries that are about to join the European Union.'She said she wants to leave the single market and 'negotiate our trade worldwide'. 'You are not doing anything to counterbalance all the immigration coming into those services,' he said.But Mr Cameron said: 'It is really worth leaving the single market damaging our economy to make progress with this issue. There is no silver bullet on this issue. There is no simple way.'Mr Cameron was roundly mocked by Twitter users during his performance. After the PM assured the audience that he would not be in Downing Street in 30 years, one wag joked that he would not last 30 days Challenged by presenter David Dimbleby that leaving the EU would in fact be a 'silver bullet', the premier insisted it would not be that simple.'I am explaining why it has been a difficult thing to do,' he said. Mr Cameron was also taken to task over his previous claim that Isis terrorists want Britain to quit the EU. David Cameron took the opportunity to hit out at Nigel Farage over his controversial poster depicting male Syrian refugees on the Slovenian border amid the refugee crisis last OctoberDavid Cameron lashed out at Nigel Farage for trying to 'frighten' voters with his controversial immigration posters as he appealed for politicians to shun hatred in respect of the late Labour MP Jo Cox.The Prime Minister was asked whether the bitter EU referendum campaign had helped create a 'sour' and divided political atmosphere in the light of Mrs Cox's death. He singled out the Ukip leader for  his 'wrong' poster published last week that told voters the EU was at 'breaking point' alongside a picture of male Syrian refugees walking along the Slovenian border during the migrant crisis last October. He said politicians should instead be reminding voters 'what she [Jo Cox] was all about, which was service, community, tolerance,' adding: 'These are values we should all try to live by and promote in order to remember her.'I think what we do know is wherever we see intolerance, hatred, division, we should try to drive it out of our communities, out of our public life and we have to be careful that debates – yes they can be passionate – but we have to make sure they're not based on those things.' Asked to give an example of the type of 'sour' strategies that had helped sew division in society, Mr Cameron took the opportunity to hit out at Mr Farage and was careful to stay away from more blue-on-blue attacks.  He said: 'To be frank I think there have been some moments like the Nigel Farage poster which I think are just wrong – wrong in fact because it's a picture of people in the European continent from Syria and elsewhere, they're not coming to Britain.'But actually wrong in motivation because it's an attempt to frighten people, to scare them, to divide people.''I think the terrorists that want to do us harm want the West to be divided,' the premier said. 'They don't want Britain and France and Belgium and Germany to work together to defeat terrorism. They'd like to see us separate from each other.'But one member of the audience in Milton Keynes asked him: 'Do you think by comparing the EU referendum to Isis, you are merely scaremongering rather than portraying the facts?' Told that he should feel 'ashamed', Mr Cameron responded: 'I certainly wasn't comparing the referendum to Isis or Daesh, I was saying that I think one of the strongest arguments for remaining in the EU is that we are stronger together, we are safer together.'We do face a dangerous and insecure world. I've been your Prime Minister for the last six years and I sit in those meetings, and I see that we work together to try to face down these threats and I think we will be stronger if we work together.'Working together against terrorism, working together against (Vladimir) Putin and his aggression in Europe, it must be better to try and stay together to work together, rather than to be separate.'At one point a man in the audience attacked Mr Cameron over his EU membership renegotiation.Comparing him to Tory predecessor Neville Chamberlain - who famously returned from talks with Hitler waving a 'piece of paper' committing to peace - the man said: ‘Mr Cameron, you say that your policy that you’ve negotiated with Europe cannot be overruled – it can.'So are you really a 21st century Neville Chamberlain waving a piece of paper in the air saying to the public this is what I have, I have this promise where a dictatorship in Europe can overrule it?' Mr Cameron responded: 'What I say is that the other 27 prime ministers and presidents have agreed it and they know if Britain votes to remain they will implement it.'Pressing on despite loud laughter from the crowd, the premier said: 'This is not some empire and dictatorship. 'We are proving through this referendum that if Britain wants to leave this organisation we can, we are a sovereign country, we choose to join Nato or we chose to join the EU'And if we choose to leave we leave, but let’s be clear if we do leave – that’s it.'We’re walking out the door, we’re quitting we’re giving up on this organisation, which even if we leave will have a huge effect on our lives, on our children, on our opportunities and on our businesses.'And I don’t think Britain at the end is a quitter, I think we should stay and fight – that’s what we should do.'Mr Cameron invoked the memory of Winston Churchill, saying: 'He didn’t quit, he didn’t quit on Europe, he didn’t quit on European democracy, he didn’t quit on European freedom.' The Tory leader refused to say that he would deploy Britain's veto to prevent Turkey joining the EU.David Cameron - who today used his Twitter feed to highlight a article praising ties with Brussels that was written by Mrs Cox days before her death - said: 'First of all let me say how shocked I think the whole country's been by this appalling murderHe insisted the issue of Turkey joining the EU was a 'red herring' because it wouldn't crop up for another three decades 'when I'm not going to be Prime Minister'.But Question Time presenter David Dimbleby pressed him on why he couldn't 'stop the discussion' over Turkey by telling the world: 'I veto this'.Mr Cameron replied: 'If this was going to happen in the next couple of years I would not support it, but it's not going to. This is about 30, 40 years' time.'  He was repeatedly challenged over whether he would quit as PM if he lost the referendum on June 23, and whether he would call a snap general election.But he insisted he would stay on and stressed that the Tory general election manifesto last year had included a commitment to hold a national vote on EU membership.  Earlier, Tory ex-defence minister Andrew Murrison complained that pro-EU figures may be exploiting the tragedy to bolster support for ties with Brussels.'Remain side spinning Jo Cox murder for partisan advantage in #EUReferendum shameful,' he wrote on Twitter.Within hours the MP had deleted the post and replaced it with one that said: 'Can both sides in this horrible #EUReferendum campaign & the press use the last few days to put case squarely, honestly and decently?'Tory MP Andrew Murrison tweeted that Remain supporters were 'spinning' Jo Cox's killing, before deleting the post and urging both sides to put their cases 'squarely, honestly and decently'Pro-EU figures have stressed the need for unity and condemned the tone of the campaign in the wake of the killing.Mr Cameron has highlighted a strongly pro-EU article Mrs Cox wrote days before her death.Alongside a link to the piece, the Prime Minister tweeted: 'Jo Cox's strong voice in the campaign to remain in the EU will be badly missed.'In a letter to the Observer today, Tony Blair, ex-deputy PM Nick Clegg and Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine say the vote is about 'what sort of country we are'.The message - which was highlighted on Twitter by David Cameron - said: 'There is something more fundamental at stake: the sort of country we are. A democracy where disagreements do not degenerate into incivility and where debate is not used to divide our communities.Boris Johnson told a rally in London today that Brexit was the best way to 'neutralise' extremists spreading fear about immigration David Cameron was branded the '21st century Neville Chamberlain' last night as he faced claims his EU reforms could be ripped up by fellow member states after Thursday's referendum.An angry audience member mocked the Prime Minister's renegotiation, which was agreed after hard-fought discussions with EU leaders earlier this year. Waving his hands to mimic Mr Chamberlain's 'peace to Europe' non-aggression pact he signed with Germany a year before the outbreak of the Second World War, the audience member challenged Mr Cameron over whether voters could trust EU leaders to honour their word over the reforms.  An angry audience member (pictured) mocked the Prime Minister's renegotiation, which was agreed after hard-fought discussions with EU leaders earlier this year'Are you really a 21st century Neville Chamberlain waving a piece of paper in the air saying to the public this is what I have, I have this promise where a dictatorship in Europe can overrule it?' the middle-aged man asked.   It drew an impassioned response from Mr Cameron, who insisted all other 27 EU leaders had agreed the changes and urged viewers to trust his European counterparts. He shot back: 'This is not some empire and dictatorship,' adding that Britain was a 'sovereign country' that can 'choose to leave' the EU. A visibly pumped up Mr Cameron added: 'But let’s be clear if we do leave – that’s it.'We’re walking out the door, we’re quitting we’re giving up on this organisation, which even if we leave will have a huge effect on our lives, on our children, on our opportunities and on our businesses.'And I don’t think Britain at the end is a quitter, I think we should stay and fight – that’s what we should do.David Cameron was branded the '21st century Neville Chamberlain' as he faced claims his EU reforms could be ripped up by fellow member states after Thursday's referendum. Pictured, Chamberlain waves his notorious 'piece of paper' after talks with Adolf HitlerAdding his own bit of history to the debate, Mr Cameron said: 'My office is it two yards away from the Cabinet room where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler, the best and greatest decision perhaps anyone’s ever made in our country.'Now he didn’t want to be alone, he wanted to be fighting with the French, with the Poles with the others.''He didn’t quit, he didn’t quit on Europe, he didn’t quit on European democracy, he didn’t quit on European freedom.' David Cameron refused three times to say he would veto Turkey’s entry into the European Union.The Prime Minister repeatedly ducked the question during his 45-minute appearance on Question Time, claiming there was no prospect of the country becoming a member in the near future.He claimed the issue was ‘the biggest red herring in this referendum debate’ and that voting to leave for fear of Turkish entry would be a ‘crazy thing to do’.But given three clear opportunities to say he would use his veto to stop it, he declined to do so.The issue of Turkish accession has been a highly charged one in the EU referendum debate, with Leave claiming free movement rules could give millions of their citizens the right to work in Britain. Brexit campaigners said Mr Cameron sidestepped the question because in truth he is a strong backer of Turkish membership of the EU saying as recently as two years ago: ‘In terms of Turkish membership of the EU, I very much support that.’Asked by audience member Michael Tindale (pictured) whether he would veto Turkey's membership of the EU, David Cameron replied: 'I don't think it's going to happen for decades so as far as I'm concerned that question simply doesn't arrive'And they pointed out that earlier this year the EU announced it would be accelerating Turkish accession as part of an agreement to deal with the migrant crisis.Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott said: ‘You cannot trust Cameron on Turkey.’Audience member Michael Tindale asked Mr Cameron: ‘Will you veto the accession of Turkey into the EU?’The Prime Minister replied: ‘I don’t think it’s going to happen for decades, so as far as I’m concerned the question doesn’t arise.‘I think this is the biggest red herring in this whole referendum debate. I can’t find a single expert anywhere in the country or in Europe who thinks that Turkey’s going to join the EU in the next three decades.’Mr Cameron said negotiations were going so slowly that ‘at this rate they’ll join in the year 3000’.He went on: ‘This issue doesn’t arise and I feel strongly about this because people are getting through their letterbox leaflets from Leave saying basically Turkey’s gong to join the EU – not true; there’s going to be a European army with Britain in it – not true; and we give £350million a week to Brussels – not true.‘If we want to vote to leave this organisation, let’s vote to leave it but let’s not do it on the basis of three things that are completely untrue.’David Cameron (pictured during the Question Time debate in Milton Keynes) refused three times to say he would veto Turkey’s entry into the European UnionAsked by host David Dimbleby whether he would veto Turkey’s entry, the Prime Minister replied: ‘It’s not going to come up’ – a response that was greeted with some jeers from the audience.‘If this was going to happen in the next couple of years I would not support it, but it’s not going to,’ he said.‘This is about 30 or 40 years’ time and I’m not going to be prime ministers in 30 or 40 years’ time. It’s a red herring.‘If people have decided to vote leave on the basis of turkey joining the EU, you’d be voting to leave an organisation, to damage our economy on the basis of something that is not going to happen.‘And that would be a crazy thing to do.’Asked for a third time by Mr Dimbleby about why he does not say at this stage he will veto Turkish entry in the future, the Prime Minister again sidestepped the question.He said Britain was being ‘positive’ to Turkey because we want it to be a ‘Western-leaning’ country, but admitted it ‘isn’t going very well at the moment’.Referring to Turkish entry, the European army and the £350million claim, he said: ‘It would be tragedy if we damaged our economy, wrecked job prospects on the basis of three things that are completely untrue.’ Nigel Farage claims his pro-Brexit immigration poster only sparked such a row because Labour MP Jo Cox was KILLED Nigel Farage today insisted there would not have been such a 'row' over Ukip's controversial pro-Brexit immigration poster if Jo Cox had not been brutally killed.The Ukip leader complained he was the 'victim' of hatred and insisted the party would be putting out more material focusing on the key issue of control over our borders.The defence came as politicians from all sides in the EU referendum battle lined up to slam the 'racist' poster. Mr Farage unveiled the image - which featured the headline 'Breaking Point' over a photograph of refugees walking into Europe through Slovenia - on Thursday just hours before Labour MP Jo Cox was shot dead and the referendum battle was suspended.Nigel Farage unveiled the controversial poster on Thursday, exactly a week before the EU referendum but was immediately condemned for the tone Michael Gove today revealed he 'shuddered' when Ukip unveiled an anti-immigration poster featuring refugees just a week before the EU referendum.The Justice Secretary said the poster, branded racist by critics, was the 'wrong thing to do'. Chancellor George Osborne, who supports the Remain campaign, also condemned the poster today as having 'echoes' of far right literature from the 1930s. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and Brexit-backing Labour MP John Mann all slammed the poster in interviews today.  Mr Gove said: 'When I saw that poster, I shuddered. I felt it was the wrong thing to do.'I must stress, I believe in free speech, I don't want to deny anyone a platform, and when I have had the opportunity to talk about migration during the course of this debate.'I hope I have been very clear I am pro-migration but the way in which we secure public support for the continued benefits migration brings, the way we secure public support for helping refugees in need is if people feel they can control the numbers overall coming here.'Chancellor George Osborne, who supports the Remain camaign, also condemned the poster today as having 'echoes' of far right literature from the 1930s.Mr Osborne told ITV's Peston on Sunday: 'I think there is a difference between addressing those concerns [about immigration] in a reasonable way and whipping up concerns, whipping up division, making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey, or saying that dead bodies are going to wash up on the beaches of Kent – or, indeed, putting up that disgusting and vile poster that Nigel Farage did which had echoes of literature used in the 1930s.'That is what we should say no to and this referendum vote is a vote on the kind of Britain we want.'Mr Farage today rejected the charge of stoking up hatred, telling ITV interviewer Robert Peston: 'I think I have been a politician who has been a victim of it, to be honest with you.'When you challenge the establishment in this country, they come after you, they call you all sorts of things. We saw the Chancellor a few minutes ago - despite the fact that overnight he talked about turning down the rhetoric - doing the same thing again.'Asked if he wished he hadn't unveiled the poster, Mr Farage replied: 'I wish an innocent Member of Parliament hadn't been gunned down on the street.'That's the point, and frankly had that not happened, I don't think we would have had the kind of row that we've had over it.'He added: 'There was a big momentum developing right across the country, [then] a tragic death... It's difficult to see where either of the campaigns go.'Mr Farage said: 'That poster reflects the truth of what's going on. We have a new poster coming out tomorrow morning and we'll unveil a new poster for every day.'Mr Gove defended the claims on immigration made by his own campaign about Turkey, insisting it was not wrong to ensure migrant numbers are controlled.Interviewed by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Gove was challenged on Vote Leave leaflets which claim Turkey's high birth rate would mean a million more people having the right to come to Britain.Mr Gove said: 'I think it is important to stress that when we are thinking about the enlargement of the European Union - and it is the official policy of the EU to accelerate Turkey's accession.'I think the fact that both the British government and the EU want Turkey and other countries to join is clear. The rate and speed at which Turkey will join will depend on a variety of political factors.'But it is the case that during the course of this year the EU want to accelerate that process and I think that when Turkey is becoming less democratic that is not the right thing to do.'Mr Gove denied discussion of Turkey's birth rate made him 'queasy' and added: 'I think it is very important when we are talking about migration to take into account numbers overall as well.'One of the things about numbers is that we benefit from migration if the numbers are controlled.' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today admitted he did not believe there could be limits placed on free movement in the EU as he claimed the Government was at fault for not giving communities resources to cope Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today renewed her criticism of the Ukip poster.She told Sky News: 'In these last few days I hope we can have a debate that doesn't focus on immigration.'Yes, people's concerns about immigration need to be addressed, but let's also make the positive case for a world and a Europe where we all have the freedom of travel and the positive case for immigration and the benefits that brings to our economy.'On that point, the poster that Nigel Farage unveiled last week was vile and racist and I hope he does agree today to withdraw that poster, because that kind of sentiment has no place in a civilised debate.'Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was asked directly whether he thought there should be an upper limit on the numbers coming to the UK.Chancellor George Osborne today said the Ukip poster had 'echoes' of 1930s literature  Mr Corbyn said: 'I don't think you can have one while you have the free movement of labour, and the free movement of labour means that you have to balance the economy.'So you have to improve living standards and conditions and so that means the EU's appalling treatment of Greece is a problem.'If you deliberately lower living standards and increase poverty in south eastern Europe, then you're bound to have a flow of people looking for somewhere to go.'Surely the issue is an anti-austerity, growth package all across Europe rather than this.'Defending his poster amid attacks from all sides of the political spectrum, Mr Farage claimed 'all' the people pictured in the poster will have EU passports within years.'This is a statement about the whole of the European Union and politically I really do think that the European Union is at breaking point,' he told the BBC as he unveiled the poster in Westminster. Mr Farage today told ITV Vote Leave should answer for their own posters.He said: 'Well, have you seen their posters? They've been doing very strong posters, not only about Turkey, but about the number of terrorists and criminals who come into Britain under free movement rules.'Brexit will NOT cause a recession but help Britain thrive, Michael Gove defiantly claims in a plea to the country to 'vote for hope' The Brexit vote is in the balance with polls showing the country may still be undecided ahead of Thursday's EU referendum. In One poll out today, by Opinium for the Observer, shows the race finely balanced at 44-44. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday shows Remain ahead 45-42 but a YouGov survey for Good Morning Britain shows Leave ahead 44 to 42. A fourth survey by BMG for Herald found Remain on 46 per cent to Leave on 43 per cent The Brexit vote is in the balance with polls showing the country may still be undecided ahead of Thursday's EU referendum.A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday found Remain had opened up a three-point lead in the wake of the killing of the Labour MP Jo Cox.But another survey revealed today shows the two sides are level while a third has voters saying they are more enthusiastic about leaving the EU than staying.Ukip leader Nigel Farage today said the killing could have halted 'momentum' behind the Leave campaign.  Campaigning was due to resume today after a suspension lasting more than two days following the fatal attack on Mrs Cox, a strong supporter of Britain staying in the EU.The man charged with her murder, Thomas Mair, gave his name as 'death to traitors, freedom for Britain' when he appeared in court on Saturday. The campaign appears to have turned around dramatically over the past few days, according to pollsLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to take part in a major BBC interview to mark Mrs Cox's death and make the case for Remain.The BBC's Andrew Marr will also interview Michael Gove as campaigning resumes with just four days to go, while Chancellor George Osborne and Ukip leader Nigel Farage are both due to be grilled by ITV's Robert Peston.Prime Minister David Cameron will take part in a live BBC Question Time special to make his case for staying in the UK.Ukip leader Nigel Farage today the 'momentum' behind the Leave campaign was halted when the referendum was halted by Mrs Cox's killing.He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: I think we have momentum.'We did have momentum until this terrible tragedy. It has had an impact on the whole campaign for everybody.'When you are taking on the establishment, you need to have momentum. I don't know what's going to happen over the course of the next three to four days, but (this was) the action of one person with serious mental issues.'What we saw was an act of terrorism.'A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday found Remain had opened up a three-point lead in the wake of the Killing of the Labour MP Jo Cox (pictured)Rival MPs could mix for tributes to Jo Cox in House of Commons Rival MPs could break with tradition and sit together in the House of Commons when they pay tribute to MP Jo Cox.Leader of the House Chris Grayling said MPs should 'do what they feel comfortable doing', while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also signalled he was open to the idea.Parliament has been recalled on Monday to allow MPs to remember Mrs Cox, who was killed in her constituency of Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire on Thursday.Neighbouring Labour MP Jason McCartney, who represents Colne Valley, has written to Speaker John Bercow requesting that backbenchers be permitted to sit together across the House in a mark of solidarity.Asked about the rules of the house, Mr Grayling said: 'I don't think there are any formal rules but I think for tomorrow's event it is a celebration and a commemoration and an expression of profound sadness and to my mind it is an occasion where people should do what they feel comfortable doing.'Meanwhile, leader of the Liberal Democrats Tim Farron said it is a 'great idea' and would show that MPs are 'united against hate'. Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'I received that suggestion last night actually and we're thinking about that and have a talk tomorrow, but tomorrow is going to be a dignified occasion, it's not going to be a time for lots of long speeches.'Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was considering whether to allow his MPs to mix in with those of other parties during Commons tributes to Jo Cox tomorrow Michael Gove, pictured today arriving for an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr Michael Gove today denied there would be a recession triggered by a Brexit vote on Thursday, rejecting an economic consensus warning of a downturn if voters quit the EU.The Justice Secretary said Britain would in fact thrive if freed from the constraints of Brussels and in an 11th hour plea to the electorate, urged them to 'vote for hope'.Mr Gove's intervention, ahead of a major TV interview today, comes as the referendum campaign gradually resumes following the shocking killing of Labour MP Jo Cox.Both sides of the referendum battle shut down for two days after the shocking events on Thursday as a shattered Westminster was left reeling by the attack.Mr Gove's intervention, in the Sunday Telegraph, urged voters to support democracy when they go to the polls on Thursday.He told the paper: 'There are great things that Britain can do in the future as a progressive beacon.'By voting Leave, we have that opportunity. 'People should vote for democracy and Britain should vote for hope.'Mr Gove said: 'I can't foretell the future but I don't believe that the act of leaving the European Union would make our economic position worse, I think it would make it better.' Amid reports some Tories are lining up Theresa May as a 'caretaker' replacement for David Cameron should he lose on Thursday, Mr Gove insisted the Prime Minister should stay on whatever the result.He told the Telegraph: 'I absolutely think that David Cameron should stay, whatever the result of the referendum and I hope that he will stay for the full second term which he was elected to serve.'I don't want to have anyone else as Prime Minister other than David Cameron and if people spend their time thinking about some of this stuff then they are getting in the way of two things: one a fair, open, fact-based referendum debate; and two, the Conservative government continuing afterwards in a stable and secure fashion.' In his own return to campaigning today, Mr Cameron warned the economy 'hangs in the balance' on Thursday.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Prime Minister said: 'If you're not sure, don't take the risk of leaving... If you don't know, don't go.'He added: 'If we choose to go out of the EU, we will go out – with all of the consequences that will have for everyone in Britain.'If we were to leave and it quickly turned out to be a big mistake, there wouldn't be a way of changing our minds and having another go.'

It is a profoundly important cause for us all.'Jo was universally liked at Westminster, not just by her Labour colleagues, but across Parliament.'In the coming days, there will be questions to answer about how and why she died. But for now all our thoughts are with Jo's husband Brendan and their two young children. They will grow up without their mum, but can be immensely proud of what she did, what she achieved and what she stood for.Labour MP Mary Creagh laid flowers close to the scene of Mrs Cox's death in Birstall , YorkshireStaff from Parliament and passers by laid their own floral tributes to the dead MP across the street from the main gates of the Palace of Westminster 'We send them our deepest condolences.

But they have lost a wife and a mother, and our hearts go out to them.'Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Labour's Yvette Cooper paid tribute to her colleage.   'I remember Jo as somebody who saw life and shook it up,' she said. 'It’s unbearable that she’s had hers stolen away. Most of us are struggling to process it. The shock has not sunk in. She never opted for the easy path, she walked towards problems rather than walk away. You saw her do that by championing the cause of refugees.‘She was brilliant. She seized on things, was a fierce advocate for what she believed in and a fiercely believed in her family. She was a fantastic mum as well as politician‘I think we all take the advice of police on closing our offices. We will all tell you it’s important for MPS to be embedded in the communities we represent. Sometimes you write people’s problems down on the back of a till receipt. Daily conversations with constituents are so important. But you also want to make sure your staff are protected.‘So many encounters you have with people are warm. These cases break hearts and hit the headlines, but at the vigil last night there were so many people there who had met Jo once or twice but as a result of her kindness wanted to pay tribute to her.David Cameron  paid tribute to Mrs Cox and said she was a 'star' in Parliament who had 'huge compassion and a big heart'‘We don’t know the circumstances in this case but there has been an increase in vitriol in public debate. Some directed at officials, and some directed at each other. There’s a feel that there is a nastiness in public debate now and none of us want to see that. It’s only four years since the Olympics where we had a feeling of pride and everyone coming together to support the country.‘There is some vitriol around part of the referendum debate which is a bit nasty but the thing about Jo is she would always argue to bring people together, have healthy debate and unite people. Like her husband said, we cannot let hate win.‘She was the host of every party, she would joke about calamine lotion for her kids chicken pox, she would joke in the corridor. It was her determination to change people’s lives which we will remember.'And Holly Lynch added: 'Jo she always seemed to have a real clarity based on her experiences about what she was there to achieve. She did that with a passion and compassion for people she represented both in her home town and right across the world. She used her personality and experience to build support for what she wanted to achieve across the chamber. You saw that in the tributes from across the political spectrum yesterday.'Ms Lynch said the balance between being active within the community, and being mindful of a potential security risk 'was a challenge for us all'. 'To be a good MP you have to be rooted in your constituency and be available as much as possible to hear people’s problems and make a difference. It’s difficult when you see something like this which is unprecedented to think about what the future looks like and about security risks.'We’ll never forget what happened to her and you do have to bear in mind the safety of your staff and so you cannot avoid taking these risks and concerns very seriously, but can’t let it stop you being an effective MP.‘We had similar constituencies. In Halifax I would regularly meet her to compare notes to what was working and what challenges we shared. We’ve all been taken aback by the nature and tone of this referendum and had conversations about what the future might mean.Mr Cameron said the loss of Jo Cox was a 'tragedy' as he offered condolences to her family, including husband Brendan and the couple's two young children Mr Cameron, pictured on Gibraltar yesterday, called off a referendum rally on the Rock in response to the killing‘We shared concerns about how you can be an effective MP dealing with people who have strong and different opinions to yours. You have to get used to working in that environment.‘Everyone who comes to see you has a serious problem and wants to work with you to solve that, but we need to work around politics so we have the ability to work with people who have different opinions and keep doing our jobs to make a difference.‘She was a hero, she just had that dynamism and clarity about what she was here to do and wanting to make a difference. She had a family and that was always a balancing act for her but she made it look easy. For the rest of us she set an example as to how it should be done and how to make a difference. She did it with a smile and an efficiency based on her experience that won her respect of colleagues across the chamber.’ Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said: 'The whole of the Labour movement is devastated at Jo's death. We have lost a colleague so young who had much more to contribute to public life. She was our future.'It is hard to comprehend how a compassionate, principled and beautiful person can be taken away from us so cruelly.

We believe in tolerance.'In the words of her husband, Brendan, Jo would have wanted us to unite against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn’t have a creed, race or religion. It is poisonous.'And we believe in freedom, liberty and justice.'Mr Osborne said the day's 'horrible events' were an 'assault on all these values'.But in a defiant conclusion, he said: 'But we know that these values, no matter how they have been challenged in the past, have always prevailed, prevail today and they will always prevail.'For they are the values of Great Britain, our great democracy.' 

Cameron pleads with voters not to use EU referendum to punish him for 'mistakes' as he fights to move on from migration row2016-6-21David Cameron has pleaded with older voters not to punish him for mistakes in government by sending Britain crashing out of the EU.In a sign of nerves in the Remain campaign, the Prime Minister took to the steps of Downing Street to deliver the appeal.Trying to draw a line under another torrid spell of pressure over his failure to curb immigration, Mr Cameron argued that the economic case for membership was 'paramount'.David Cameron made the desperate appeal for voters to support Britain's EU membership outside Downing Street todayThe premier said a vote to leave on Thursday would be 'irreversible'. 'I know I haven't got everything right... but of this I am convinced... Britain is better off inside the EU than out on our own.' Mr Cameron said he wanted to speak directly to 'my generation and older' to think about their children and grandchildren. 'I know Europe isn't perfect, believe me I understand and I see those frustrations. I feel them myself,' he said.'That's why we negotiated and enhanced our special status - out of the euro, keeping our borders, not involved in ever closer union. We have the best of both worlds.'So as you take this decision, whether to remain or leave, do think about the hopes and dreams of your children and grandchildren. They know their chances to work, to travel, to build the sort of open and successful society they want to live in rests on this outcome.'And remember, they can't undo the decision we take. If we vote out, that's it. It is irreversible. We will leave Europe for good.'The next generation will have to live with the consequences far longer than the rest of us.'On Thursday 'it will just be you in that polling booth', he said, 'taking a decision that will affect your future, your children's future, your grandchildren's future'.He added: 'Our economic security is paramount. It will be stronger if we stay; if we leave we will put it at risk.'That is a risk to jobs, a risk to families, a risk to our children's future and there is no going back.' The intervention, with just two days left to go until the polls open, came as a former aide claimed that Mr Cameron was told four years ago his immigration target was 'impossible' while Britain is in the EU.Steve Hilton, the PM's ex-policy guru, said Whitehall officials had given the warning during meetings in 2012.The civil servants said 'directly and explicitly' that the net migration goal was not deliverable given EU freedom of movement rules.Despite this, the Prime Minister has repeatedly restated his ambition to hit the target – even including it in his 2015 general election manifesto. At no stage has he succeeded in cutting net migration to below 100,000.Mr Cameron denied the claims today and insisted that when Mr Hilton left government in 2012 immigration was falling and was close to the target. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Hilton recalls the warning to Mr Cameron, saying: 'We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it.' But Mr Cameron told ITV this morning: 'It's simply not right. Actually when Steve Hilton left Downing Street in 2012, net immigration had actually fallen quite substantially and it got down to 154,000, so not far away from the ambition that I set.'But look there are good ways of controlling immigration and my welfare break, saying that people who come and work here, have to work here for four years before they get full access to our welfare system, that's a good way, but pulling out of the single market, wrecking our economy, that is a bad way.' Mr Hilton told BBC News the PM's statement in Downing Street was 'weird' and designed to move the focus away from immigration.'It was very interesting actually and rather an amazing thing to hear because what you just saw from the Prime Minister was an admission that they have lost the economic argument, they have lost the argument on immigration and so he has been wheeled out by rather panicky spin doctors, it seems to me, to try and change the subject,' he said, Mr Cameron admitted he had not got everything right in government, but stressed that he and every other living politician who had served as Prime Minister thought the UK was stronger in the EU

It was claimed her attacker shouted 'Britain First' as he targeted the MP in broad daylight.Dramatic pictures show a man being arrested just minutes after the attack in a nearby street.There is unconfirmed evidence Mair supported far-Right causes and claims he had mental health problems and had been released recently from psychiatric care.The MP was an outspoken supporter of the Remain campaign and had called for more refugees to be given a safe haven on our shores. Last night her husband, charity worker Brendan Cox, 37, said he would dedicate 'every moment' of the rest of his life to his wife's memory.'Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy, and a zest for life that would exhaust most people,' he said.Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

Hate doesn't have a creed, race or religion, it is poisonous.'Jo would have no regrets about her life, she lived every day of it to the full.'Two hours after her death, Mr Cox – with whom she has two young children, aged three and five - tweeted a photograph of her and urged people to 'fight against the hatred that killed her.'In a moving statement, he said: '[This] is the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. More difficult, more painful, less joyful, less full of love. I and Jo's friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo.'Her parents, Gordon and Jean Leadbeater, who live in the small village of Roberttown, West Yorkshire said the family were 'in shock'.  Mrs Cox's killing has sent shockwaves across the country with MPs across the political spectrum paying warm tribute to her.Elected to represent Batley and Spen last year, the Cambridge University graduate had already earned great respect for her work ethic and humanitarian campaigning.David Cameron said the country has 'lost a great star' as the Leave and Remain camps suspended campaigning.The murder took place outside Birstall Library in a busy shopping street just before 1pm. Mrs Cox was walking to a constituency surgery – advertised on posters inside the building – after attending a school assembly about three miles away.Witnesses said a man in a baseball cap grabbed her, pulling her hair as he punched and kicked her to the ground. As bystanders attempted to intervene, he pulled out a large hunting knife and repeatedly stabbed the MP, also catching a 77-year-old man in the stomach as he tried to intervene.He then pulled out what appeared to be an antique gun which he fired three times from just a few feet away, aiming the final shot at her head. Some witnesses claimed he looked 'full of range' as he shot her at close-range.One man said the killer deliberately moved in to finish off the MP, firing a final shot to 'the head area' in a horrific attack that lasted up to 15 minutes. A picture has been circulated on social media that is said to show the suspect being arrested after the attack in Leeds yesterday afternoonA picture was taken of the man believed to be the suspect seconds after he was tackled to the ground by two uniformed police officersDramatic news footage shows the moment the 52-year-old man was arrested in connection with the attack on Mrs Cox in Birstall, LeedsA view of the scene of the shooting outside the library in Birstall, where Mrs Cox was attending a constituency meeting yesterdayForensic officers are seen outside the home of the attacker, who has been named locally as Thomas Mair, as the investigation continuesBritain First, a far-right  party, has tonight distanced itself from the attack. The groups' leader Paul Golding (pictured) took to its official website to issue a video  condemning the 'heinous' attackEyewitnesses claim the gunman shouted 'Britain first' as he carried out the horrific attack on Mrs Cox.However, Britain First - a British nationalist political party which campaigns against immigration, multiculturalism and Islam - has now distanced itself from the attack and denied any connection.The group's leader, former British National Party councillor Paul Golding, claimed the attacker could have shouted 'It's time to put Britain first', as he dismissed eyewitness accounts as 'hearsay'.The leader of the far right party said: 'She has been out campaigning to keep Britain in the EU and there are people in the area that are against it.'I don't think it was one of our supporters. We stand in elections and organise protests - we don't encourage this kind of nonsense.'She has a young family - an attack on a mum like that is disgraceful.'Whether you agree with Labour, to have had that happen to her on the streets is shocking and an indictment of the state of this country.'In a video message released following the announcement that Mrs Cox had died from her injuries, he added: 'This is a terrible day for our democracy, for our parliamentary system. Our MPs are the representatives of the people and they have been for over 400 years now.'So this is a very dark day for our country and for our democracy. We do not know what was said. At the moment, it is pure hearsay.'It's an attack on a mother, it's an attack on our parliamentary system. It's just a downright act of criminality on the streets of Yorkshire. That's what we believe, that's what we think.'I hope the person who carried out this heinous crime gets what he deserves.'Britain First also issued a statement denying any involvement, suggesting that the phrase 'could have been a slogan rather than a reference to our party'.A spokesman said: 'Britain First obviously is not involved and would never encourage behaviour of this sort.' Britain First, which was founded in 2011 by Jim Downson, an anti-abortion campaigner linked to Ulster loyalist militants, is in favour of preserving what it deems 'traditional British culture'.The movement first attracted attention by protesting outside homes of alleged Islamists. It has also been known to carry out 'Christian patrols' and 'invasions' of British mosques and is known for online activism.It has contested elections to the House of Commons, the European Parliament and the mayoralty of London, but has not held any elected posts. The group is also against immigration - an issue which Mrs Cox has spoken positively about.  It has raised suspicions that her attacker was opposing her political views when he fatally shot her. Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

Doctors said last night that he was expected to make a full recovery.Witness Clarke Rothwell, who runs a cafe near where the attack took place, said the attacker shouted 'Britain first' as he carried out the sickening attack.He said: 'He was stabbing her with a foot-long knife multiple times while shouting 'Britain first, Britain first, Britain first'.'Three times she was shot, the initial time which then she dropped to the floor, and two more times.'The third time he got close proximity, he shot her round the head area.'He added: 'In the meantime he was stabbing her as well, he was stabbing her with his knife.'The 42-year-old said he had rushed to the scene after hearing a 'popping sound'. He said he turned around to find the gunman standing over her.'He seemed to have what looked like an old gun, like a musket, in his hand and he shot her again in the middle,' he said.'He then seemed to shoot a third time, towards her head or face. He was also stabbing at her with what looked like a hunting knife, about a foot long. He was stabbing her and waving the knife around.'A man who I know... tried to get near but the man swung his knife around and caught him in the stomach. Blood started coming out.'Mr Rothwell said his friend 'tried to grab him, wrestling with him,' but the killer lunged at the MP 'half a dozen times' with the knife.He said the sound of the gunshots sparked pandemonium, with people 'screaming and running from the area'.Mr Rothwell said he attempted to follow the attacker in his van and saw him dump his jacket on the ground, possibly in an attempt to change his appearance. Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

He said he saw Mrs Cox lying on the ground between two parked cars.The man suspected of killing Labour MP Jo Cox confessed to feeling ‘socially isolated and disconnected from society’ as a result of long-term mental illness, it emerged last night.Detectives were last night questioning 52-year-old Thomas Mair, amid fears he was motivated by Mrs Cox’s political campaigning.There is unconfirmed evidence Mair supported far-Right causes and claims he had mental health problems and had been released recently from psychiatric care.  It was also revealed that he volunteered at a special school several times a week.Friends said Mair had never shown any interest in politics or the EU referendum. The only possible clue to Mair’s political leanings yesterday was that his name and address appear on a list of former subscribers to an anti-ANC pro-white South African magazine. The newspaper, then known as the South African Patriot, rejected 'multi-cultural societies, expansionist Islam and third world tyrants', and supported 'imperial solidarity'. In 1987, it moved to the UK 'following the fall of civilized rule in South Africa'.Finding solace through volunteer work as a gardener, he was regarded as a quiet but friendly loner by neighbours on the estate on a hill above the murder scene where he had lived since childhood.Mair also regularly helped his mother Mary, 69, who last night told friends she feels responsible for what he is alleged to have done. ‘She’s blaming herself,’ one said. ‘I told her she can’t blame herself, she can’t be responsible for other people’s actions, but she is. She’s devastated.’ At home last night, Mrs Mair said: ‘I don’t understand it, I just don’t understand.’Duane St Louis, age 41, the suspect’s half-brother, said Mair had 'never expressed any views about Britain, or politics or racist tendencies'.He said: 'I’m mixed race and I’m his half-brother, we got on well. He never married. The only time I remember him having a girlfriend was as a young man, but a mate stole her off him. He said that put him off [women] for life.’He added: ‘It feels like a dream that I want to wake up from. I couldn’t believe it when I saw a picture of him on the news in handcuffs.’In 2010 the alleged gunman had spoken to a local newspaper of how volunteering at a park near his home on the Fieldhouse estate in Birstall had helped improve his mental health.‘I can honestly say it has done me more good than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world,’ he told The Huddersfield Daily Examiner.‘Many people who suffer from mental illness are socially isolated and disconnected from society, feelings of worthlessness are also common mainly caused by long-term unemployment. All these problems are alleviated by doing voluntary work.’Mair also volunteered several times a week at a special school in Dewsbury. He said: 'I saw a man wrestling with a guy with a baseball cap, trying to restrain him, but he shrugged him off. All of a sudden he started shouting and he pulled a gun from his bag. It looked like an old shotgun, maybe with a shortened barrel, the size of a cucumber. Then he fired and three or four seconds later he fired again. Bang, bang.'At the first shot everyone ran, but then the adrenaline kicked in and we went closer again.'He then just calmly walked away down the street.'Mr Abdallah said the killer looked like he was in a 'rage' as he pulled the trigger.Describing the gun as looking 'handmade', he added: 'She was a standing-still target for him when he shot her.'The man stepped back with the gun and fired it and then he fired a second shot.'As he was firing he was looking down at the ground.'She was sat on the floor and looked like she was on the beach, her hair was roughed up, her face and legs were bloody.' Mr Abdallah said the MP appeared to be unconscious.It was earlier thought Mrs Cox had intervened in a fight between two men but it is now believed that her attacker was lying in wait. One witness said he believed the attacker was waiting for Mrs Cox outside the library where she was holding the surgery with her constituent members.Car-wash worker Karman Kinder said he saw her lying on the ground as a woman standing beside her screamed: 'Oh Jo! Oh Jo!'He said there was a man lying on the floor nearby who looked as if he had been injured.Mr Kinder added that he saw the gunman rushing away seconds after the shots were fired.'As I went up the road there was a guy on the other side, hurrying down the street. He looked old and had his face down and then I saw he was holding a gun in his hand,' he said.'Other people were chasing him and he disappeared into a side street. It was terrifying.'Aamir Tahir, of The Dry Clean Centre, said the gunman was heard shouting 'Britain first'.He said: 'The lady I work with heard two loud bangs. I wish I was there because I would have tried to stop him.'Apparently the guy who did it shouted 'Britain first' and if I had been there I would have tackled him.'Graeme Howard, 38, who lives nearby, told the Guardian that he also heard the man shout 'Britain first' before the shooting and during the arrest.He said: 'I heard the shot and I ran outside and saw some ladies from the cafe running out with towels. There was loads of screaming and shouting and the police officers showed up.'He was shouting 'Britain first' when he was doing it and being arrested. He was pinned down by two police officers and she was taken away in an ambulance.'Britain First is the name of a far-Right group opposed to immigration, multiculturalism and the UK's membership of the EU. Its leader, former BNP councillor Paul Golding yesterday posted a video online saying the attack was 'disgusting' while the group said it was 'not involved and would never encourage behaviour of this sort'.Passers-by immediately tended to the stricken MP and police and paramedics were on the scene within minutes.Witnesses feared the worst as paramedics performed CPR on Mrs Cox for up to 15 minutes before she was airlifted to hospital.As a manhunt was launched for the killer, local shops and a primary school just 50 yards away from the scene of the attack were immediately put on 'lockdown', with no one allowed in or out.However, shortly afterwards, two police officers arrested the suspect.He did not try to resist, and photographs showed him sprawled on the road with officers standing over him and what appeared to be trail of blood by his arm.Later they recovered the gun and a bloody machete-style knife. A team of officers were searching his council home, less than one mile away, where he has lived virtually all his life.Neighbours said Mair, a voracious reader, volunteer gardener and special needs helper, was a regular visitor to the library where Mrs Cox held her surgery.They said the semi-detached council house had been his home since childhood and said he had lived there alone since his grandmother died about 20 years ago.The house is one of a number of addresses being searched by police as part of the investigation into Ms Cox's death. David Pickles, a neighbour of Mair, said: 'He's just quiet. He kept himself to himself. He lived by himself. He's been on his own for about 20 years. I've never seen a lot of people visiting or anything like that.'Fellow neighbour Katherine Cooke, 62, said Mair had walked past her house at 12.20pm yesterday. ‘He looked the same as he always does,’ she said. ‘The only difference was, he had a rucksack on.’Mair regularly helped his mother bringing shopping to her Batley home and helping in the garden.One neighbour said: ‘He doted on his mum, he was round here twice a week bringing her shopping and things. He was devoted to her.’ Another added: ‘He was a lovely lad. This is completely out of character.’ There is evidence Mair subscribed to a pro-white publication 'SA Patriot', an inflammatory tiny circulation magazine based in London. One online message group described him as 'one of the earliest subscribers and supporters' of the magazine.But his brother Scott, 49, said Mair showed no strong political views. 'He has a history of mental illness, but he has had help,' he said.The suspect's devastated mother, Mary, who also lives in Birstall, was being comforted by friends. One said: 'She's really upset about the children. She's blaming herself.'Duane St Louis, 41, Mair's half-brother, said he had obsessive compulsive disorder. At his home in Dewsbury, he said: 'He'd clean himself with Brillo pads.' Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

The image was shared on Twitter by Channel 4 News correspondent Michael CrickPolice investigating the killing of MP Jo Cox have confirmed they recovered weapons, 'including a firearm', from the crime scene. Conflicting reports have emerged over what type of gun was used in the attack, but it is believed to have been an antique weapon - and one witness described seeing an 'old gun, like a musket'. Hichem Ben Abdallah, 56, was in the cafe next door to the library when he heard screaming and went outside and found a man trying to fight off the attacker, named locally as Thomas Mair, as he wrestled Mrs Cox on the street. He reportedly drew a picture of the gun for Channel 4 News correspondent Michael Crick, which was later shared on Twitter. It shows what appears to be an old-fashioned gun, which he said was the 'size of an average cucumber'. Speaking after the attack, Mr Ben Abdallah said: 'There was a guy who was being very brave and another guy with a white baseball cap who he was trying to control and the man in the baseball cap suddenly pulled a gun from his bag.'He was fighting with her and wrestling with her and then the gun went off and then she fell between two cars and I came and saw her bleeding on the floor.'Gas engineer Witness Clarke Rothwell, 42, was outside the sandwich shop close to the library when he heard a 'popping sound'.  'I looked round and there was a guy standing over a woman on the floor,' he said.'He seemed to have what looked like an old gun, like a musket, in his hand and he shot her.'Mrs Cox, lived with her husband and two young children on a houseboat on the Thames. Before winning her seat last May she worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown's wife, Sarah, and Lady Kinnock.She has become the first woman MP ever to be murdered and the first MP to be killed since the murder of Conservative Ian Gow in a 1990 IRA bomb blast.MPs warned they were in danger in a committee report last year which highlighted increasing complaints of obsessive stalkers. Several MPs complained they had been confronted by obsessives armed with knives and guns.Last night, a vigil was held by colleagues outside Parliament and by friends and neighbours at Mrs Cox's Thames houseboat, where owners sounded their horns in a two-minute tribute to the MP.  Candles were lit along the gangway down to the jetty and hundred of flowers and pictures were placed on the vessel she shared with her husband. Anne Wainwright chair of the Heritage Moorings said: 'We are a very tight community. We're all pulling together. It's just so awful.'Lots of people came to lay flowers last night, tributes have come from all over the world, it was rally amazing.'We burnt some of our horns out because we sounded them for two minutes straight.'I spoke to Jo's husband Brendan last night and we've exchanged some messages.'He's obviously in bits, I can't imagine what he's going through. And her parents as well, it's so terrible, we're in such shock.'I'm not sure when her family are coming back but when Brendan comes back we'll talk about any further tributes as a community.'It has been mentioned that her name might get put on a bench nearby, but we're not sure yet.'Jo was such a lovely person, she was tiny but had so much energy. She loved her work so much she had to get back to work after being a full time mum.'A book of condolence was also set up for residents. One tribute left read: 'You have left a world that is changed by your humanity and empathy for the plight of others.'May your lasting legacy be one that remembers that joyful optimism and tireless work really does change the world. Rest in peace Jo.'Another tribute read: 'From one mother to another may your joy live on through your children.'It came as politicians up and down the country paid tribute to Mrs Cox, who was described as 'one of the brightest MPs'.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: 'Jo was universally liked at Westminster, not just by her Labour colleagues, but across Parliament.'In the coming days, there will be questions to answer about how and why she died. But for now all our thoughts are with Jo's husband Brendan and their two young children. They will grow up without their mum, but can be immensely proud of what she did, what she achieved and what she stood for.'Prime Minister David Cameron added: 'The death of Jo Cox is a tragedy. She was a committed and caring MP. My thoughts are with her husband Brendan and her two young children.'Campaigning for the EU referendum by Britain Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave has now been suspended for the day after the attack.Commenting on the attack, temporary Chief Constable Dee Collins said: 'Just before 1pm [yesterday] Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, was attacked in Market Street, Birstall. I am now very sad to have to report that she has died as a result of her injuries. Before going into further detail, I would like to express our deepest sympathies to her family and friends at this tragic time.'Jo was attacked by a man who inflicted serious and sadly ultimately fatal injuries. There was a subsequently an attack on a 77 year old man nearby who has sustained injuries that are non-life threatening. Shortly afterwards a man was arrested nearby by police officers. Weapons, including a firearm, have also been recovered.'At 1.48pm Jo was pronounced dead by a doctor working with a paramedic crew who was treating her injuries. This is a very serious investigation with a large number of witnesses that are being spoken to by police at this time. There is a large and significant crime scene. There is a large police presence in the area. A full investigation is underway to establish the motive of this attack. Mrs Cox, who died from her injuries after being shot and stabbed yesterday, is pictured above on her wedding day with husband BrendanLabour MPs Yvette Cooper, Rachel Reeves and Judith Cummins attend a vigil at St Peter's church in Birstall tonight in memory of Mrs CoxLabour MP Yvette Cooper was seen wiping away tears as she broke down during the vigil in honour of Mrs Cox who was killed yesterdayPictured left to right: MPs Yvette Cooper (Pontefract and Castleford), Naz Shah (Bradford West) and Dan Jarvis (Barnsley Central), attending a vigil for Mrs Cox in St. Peter's Church, Birstall, near Leeds.

And we would ask the media to respect their privacy at this difficult time. Additional officers are working with the local community this evening, in order to provide support and reassurance to our communities.'Clearly as our inquiry is at a very early stage, and we have an individual under arrest, we are not in the position to discuss any motive at this time. We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.'She added: 'We are attending a number of scenes as part of this investigation and we will be looking very closely at what evidence we may or may not be able to recover.'Cambridge graduate Mrs Cox was elected to the seat of Batley and Spen at the last general election in 2015, having previously worked in aid.She is national chair of Labour Women's Network, and has worked for various charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and the NSPCC.The mother of two young children, who is said to enjoy mountain-climbing, boating and running, worked for Oxfam between 2001 and 2009 in a variety of different roles - and it was while working for the charity that she met her husband and father of her children, Brendan.As head of Oxfam's Brussels office she spearheaded Oxfam's campaign for trade reform. In 2005 she joined Oxfam GB as head of advocacy.Paying tribute, the charity's Max Lawson said: 'Jo was a diminutive pocket rocket from the north. She was as a ball of energy, always smiling, full of new ideas, of idealism, of passion. She gave so much to Oxfam.'She was an inspiring leader, really bringing the best out of all of us, always positive, always believing we could win, and always passionate for change.'She was particularly brilliant at bringing huge energy to our campaigning around the desperate humanitarian crisis in Darfur.'Oxfam GB's Chief Executive, Mark Goldring, added: 'Oxfam is proud of the role that Jo played in our work over a decade. Many of our colleagues remember her fondly. The rest of us followed her work with admiration. She never lost her passion for peace, justice and equality.'Everyone is deeply shocked to hear the news. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Brendan and Jo's family at this difficult time.' Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

There have also been concerns that backbenchers could be a soft target for Islamic State extremists.Details of the extra security measures were not published, but they are thought to include more funding for alarms, locks and CCTV in constituencies and homes. Police carry out assessments of what risk MPs face.The watchdog authorised £77,234 of spending on additional security measures last year - more than double the sum in the previous 12 months. Jo Cox worked for Oxfam before she entered parliament as MP for Batley and Spen at the general election last year.A mother of two young children, she is married to Brendan Cox, a former adviser to Gordon Brown who has also been chief executive of Save the children.The 41-year-old also worked closely with Mr Brown's wife Sarah on efforts to prevent mothers and babies dying needlessly in pregnancy.Since entering the Commons, she has made a name for herself by campaigning on Syria issues, including calling for the UK to enforce a no-fly zone.In 2015 she abstained in a vote on whether we should join airstrikes.Ms Cox nominated Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader, but is regarded as a moderate within the party and is very popular among her fellow MPs.Yesterday, it emerged that a 37-year-old man had been arrested following a death threat made to Labour MP Ben Bradshaw.The arrest follows an alleged campaign of extreme right-wing racist and homophobic abuse aimed at Mr Bradshaw and his staff.Devon and Cornwall Police said the man was held for questioning after a call was recorded at the Labour MP for Exeter’s office at Westminster. Scottish Secretary David Mundell revealed today that he had once received a death threat after MPs backed airstrikes against ISIS in Syria.The minister said police had advised him of a 'credible' threat in the wake of a Commons vote in favour of the action in December 2015.He said, however, that Mrs Cox would not have wanted politicians to 'pull up the shutter' and become less accessible to the public.Speaking after a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Glasgow, he said: 'I didn’t make it public at the time, but immediately after the Syria vote I received what police regarded as a credible death threat.'It’s very concerning, not just for yourself but for your family, your staff in particular.'The police do offer very good guidance and support in relation to how to carry out your duties in the safest possible way.'But, ultimately, accessibility is at the heart of politics and you can’t let those people who want to disrupt our political system win by refusing to be accessible to the public.'I know Jo Cox would not have wanted us to pull the shutter up as a response to yesterday’s dreadful events.'He criticised the 'vilification' politicians are subjected to, saying “we’ve come to accept abuse and name-calling as a matter of course'.He continued: 'When people hear about Jo, they understand that she is the exact opposite of the stereotype, somebody who wasn’t in it for themselves, somebody who took huge personal sacrifices, having a young family, having to come to London, because she wanted to do better for her community and the wider world.'Last night, Lord Porter, Chairman of the Local Government Association, offered his condolences to Mrs Cox's family and friends.He said: 'On behalf of everyone in local government I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Jo Cox.

Then I was thrown into a Cambridge environment where I just didn't get it. It shook me. All my norms and everything I was used to didn't feel like they were right anymore.' She went on to work as an adviser for the Labour MP Joan Walley and Baroness, before embarking on a successful career as an aide worker. She was married to Brendan Cox, a former adviser to Gordon Brown who has also been chief executive of Save the children.The 41-year-old also worked closely with Mr Brown's wife Sarah on efforts to prevent mothers and babies dying needlessly in pregnancy.Since entering the Commons, she has made a name for herself by campaigning on Syria issues, including calling for the UK to enforce a no-fly zone.In 2015 she abstained in a vote on whether we should join airstrikes.Mrs Cox nominated Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader, but is regarded as a moderate within the party and is very popular among her fellow MPs. Jo Cox (pictured) was among the rising stars in Parliament before she was shot dead on the streets of her Yorkshire constituencyDays before she died, Jo Cox took part in the traditional tug of war against the House of Lords Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

My thoughts are with Jo's husband Brendan, her two children, and their wider family.'We have lost a great star. She was a great campaigning MP with huge compassion and a big heart and people are going to be very, very sad at what has happened. Dreadful, dreadful news.'It's right we are suspending campaigning activity in this referendum and everyone's thought will be with Jo's family and with her constituents at this terrible time.'Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: 'The whole of the Labour Party and Labour family - and indeed the whole country - will be in shock at the horrific murder of Jo Cox.'Jo had a lifelong record of public service and a deep commitment to humanity. She worked both for Oxfam and the anti-slavery charity, the Freedom Fund, before she was elected last year as MP for Batley and Spen – where she was born and grew up.'Jo was dedicated to getting us to live up to our promises to support the developing world and strengthen human rights – and she brought those values and principles with her when she became an MP.'Jo died doing her public duty at the heart of our democracy, listening to and representing the people she was elected to serve. It is a profoundly important cause for us all.'Jo was universally liked at Westminster, not just by her Labour colleagues, but across Parliament.'In the coming days, there will be questions to answer about how and why she died. But for now all our thoughts are with Jo's husband Brendan and their two young children. They will grow up without their mum, but can be immensely proud of what she did, what she achieved and what she stood for.'We send them our deepest condolences. We have lost a much loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for social justice and peace. But they have lost a wife and a mother, and our hearts go out to them.'Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said: 'The whole of the Labour movement is devastated at Jo's death. We have lost a colleague so young who had much more to contribute to public life. She was our future.'It is hard to comprehend how a compassionate, principled and beautiful person can be taken away from us so cruelly. It's even more devastating because she was doing what she did best - serving her constituents.'We grieve her loss. Our love and prayers are with Brendan and Jo's family.'Commons speaker John Bercow said: 'I am absolutely devastated to learn the news about Jo Cox. 'Jo was an outstanding Member of Parliament and a wonderful, kind, caring person who was liked and respected in all parts of the House.'My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this harrowing time.'Mr Cameron said the loss of Jo Cox was a 'tragedy' as he offered condolences to her family, including husband Brendan and their children  Union Jack flags were seen flying at half mast from the roof of Downing street in London this evening in honour of Mrs CoxEgoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

My heart breaks for her family.'   George Osborne tonight cancelled a major address on the economy and referendum to pay an emotional tribute to Jo CoxGeorge Osborne tonight cancelled a major address on the economy and referendum to pay an emotional tribute to Jo Cox.He said all MPs had been rocked by the 'appalling, shattering news' of her death when it was confirmed by West Yorkshire Police shortly after 5pm.But a week before a vote that will define his career, Mr Osborne said 'freedom, liberty and justice' would prevail over the 'hatred that killed her'.The Chancellor welcomed the decision to suspend campaigning on the EU referendum with less than a week to polling day out of respect for the tragic events in Birstall.Mr Osborne, speaking at the annual Mansion House dinner, said Mrs Cox had died 'serving her constituents, serving our democracy'.And Mr Osborne reflected on how all MPs making themselves available to their constituents is 'one of the virtues of our Parliamentary democracy'.He said: 'It's what makes the way we govern ourselves very different from many others.'To be an effective representative, all of us who are MPs engage with their communities, talk to everyone and anyone, hold constituency surgeries and must be prepared to stand up and argue publicly for what we believe.'Jo did all of these things.'The Chancellor said the Batley and Spen MP had been 'liked and respected across the House' after making an immediate impact since her election last year.He said shed changed attitudes and helped change Government policy despite being a new, backbench, opposition MP.Mr Osborne said: 'She will never know how many lives she helped transform.'Doing that job, she senselessly lost her own life.'Not since Ian Gow lost his life to an IRA bomb twenty six years ago has an MP been murdered, but others since have faced attack, injury and intimidation.'The Chancellor continued: ' We believe in Parliamentary democracy.'MPs have the privilege of representing the views of those who voted for them and those who did not. We believe in tolerance.'In the words of her husband, Brendan, Jo would have wanted us to unite against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn't have a creed, race or religion. It is poisonous.'And we believe in freedom, liberty and justice.'Mr Osborne said the day's 'horrible events' were an 'assault on all these values'.But in a defiant conclusion, he said: 'But we know that these values, no matter how they have been challenged in the past, have always prevailed, prevail today and they will always prevail.'For they are the values of Great Britain, our great democracy.'How MPs' security was beefed up this year after they voiced fears about lack of protectionBy James Tapsfield for MailOnline MPs were given extra protection this year after fears were raised about their safetySecurity for MPs was beefed up earlier this year after fears were raised about a lack of protection from people with 'knives and guns'.The expenses watchdog announced an 'enhanced' package for politicians outside the parliamentary estate in January after a survey carried out by the Commons authorities revealed extreme concern about their own safety and that of their staff.Details of the extra measures were not published, but they are thought to include more funding for alarms, locks and CCTV in constituencies and homes. Police carry out individual assessments of what risk MPs face.The watchdog had already more than doubled the amount of spending authorised on security away from the Commons to £77,234 last year.The internal report prepared by House staff following interviews with MPs said: 'Security was raised as a key concern by many participants; this related both to their constituency offices and their accommodation in London and largely related to what expenses they could or could not claim under Ipsa rules ...'It was felt that the limitations of the office allowance that could be claimed meant offices could often only be situated in out of town areas, or deprived areas of town, where rentals were below premium.'This had potential implications for the security of staff, who were often women working alone or in pairs. Participants also stressed that security is important as staff can be at risk due to the number of constituents they deal with that have mental health issues.''Others raised concerns about safety in their London accommodation. Although there is a separate allowance for security measures in their constituency offices, most participants understood that they had to pay for security measures for their London home from the London accommodation budget, which because of the very high rental prices in London was very difficult to do.''A few MPs gave examples of incidents involving stalkers, and those with knives and guns, which although not just issues for women, were ones where some women felt they were more vulnerable.'A few were aware that concerns could be reported to the Police or via the Sergeant at Arms; but others did not know this and referred to difficulties in getting advice and support.'The document went on: 'Many women stressed that if they were travelling between Westminster and their London accommodation, or back to their constituencies when it was dark, they would prefer to take a taxi as they felt it was safer.'They were concerned that this was not allowed under IPSA guidance unless it was past a specific hour, and that even then it was subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, which deterred many women from so doing.'Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle carried out a review the security provision away from parliament last year, and at one point there was pressure for Ipsa to be stripped of responsibility for funding security away from parliament.In a letter to politicians in January, chief executive Marcial Boo said the expenses watchdog had always 'taken seriously the need for MPs and their staff to besecure'.Referring to high-profile protests against MPs over the vote on bombing Syria and concerns that backbenchers could be a soft target for IS extremists, he wrote: 'Recent events have led us, with the police and the House of Commons, to take stock of our arrangements to ensure that they are appropriate to changed circumstances.'This letter announces enhancements to the security measures available to you and your staff.'Ipsa has distributed - but not published - guidance prepared by the National Counter Terrorism Security Office and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

'A very British apocalypse – it was over by tea time!' Ukip brushes off tales of doom as the pound rallies and businesses vow to adapt despite initial turmoil when Brexit was announced 2016-6-24A leading Ukip figure brushed off fears of economic turmoil after the stock market staged a dramatic fight-back, the pound rallied and a major bank denied reports it was planning to move 2,000 jobs abroad following the dramatic Brexit vote.Summing up yesterday's events, Suzanne Evans, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner and Ukip spokesperson, wrote on her Facebook: 'If this was the predicted apocalypse, well, it was a very British one. It was all over by teatime. Not a bad first day of freedom.'The about-turn in the markets was sparked by the Bank of England pledging to do whatever it takes to prevent a full-blown financial crisis. In the hours after the Brexit vote, the pound plunged to a 31-year low, and the FTSE 100 index sank 550 points or 8.7 per cent in a matter of minutes yesterday morning.But the stock market clawed back more than half its losses as the day wore on, before closing down 3.2 per cent or 199.41 points at 6138.69.The blue-chip index of leading British companies finished the week 2 per cent higher than it started, despite warnings of catastrophe following Brexit.Business groups, many of which had campaigned for a Remain vote, said the British economy was flexible enough to adapt to the Brexit vote and resilient enough to stave off economic shocks.  The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Institute of Directors warned politicians not to rush into decisions that will 'affect generations to come'. Fears over international isolationism were also short-lived as President Obama said the 'special relationship' between the US and Britain was still intact. Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, said negotiations with Britain would be conducted in an 'orderly way' to avoid 'prolonged uncertainty'. Summing up yesterday's events, Suzanne Evans, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner and Ukip spokesperson, wrote: 'If this was the predicted apocalypse, well, it was a very British one. It was all over by teatime. Not a bad first day of freedom'Drop: The FTSE 100 fell off a cliff on Friday morning - down almost 8% - as Britain's vote for Brexit became clear - but hours later it rallied towards the levels of last weekClaims by the mayor of Calais that the city's migrant camps would transfer to England were also dismissed by the French President Francois Hollande. Fears of mass job losses were also quickly quashed after the American investment bank Morgan Stanley denied initial speculation that it was considering shifting 2,000 jobs to Dublin and Frankfurt. The pound recovered to 1.36 US dollars after slumping to 1.33 as the EU referendum results came through The pound rallied last night after crashing to its lowest level in 30 years following Britain's dramatic decision to quit the EU.   Sterling plunged 10 per cent against the dollar overnight to 1.33 US dollars, a low not seen since 1985, as the Leave campaign clinched victory. The fall, which settled at 9 per cent  in afternoon trading, represents one of the biggest daily falls on record for a major currency.Sterling recovered to 1.36 US dollars later in the afternoon.British fund manager Neil Woodford, who looks after more than £14billion of savers' cash, played down fears over the impact of Brexit – and said the fall in the pound would result in a 'windfall' for exporters. David Buik, an analyst at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, blamed the initial economic turbulence following the Brexit vote on the 'apocalyptic hysteria whipped up by the Establishment' prior to the referendum. 'They are responsible for a large portion of the fall in the value of the pound and share prices,' he said.  A spokesman for the bank said there were no immediate plans to make changes and said it would wait until Britain had secured a new relationship with Europe before deciding on long-term restructuring. 'The UK's vote to leave the European Union is a very significant decision which will have a considerable impact, the extent of which will not be known for some time,' the spokesman said.'There will be at least a period of two years before an actual exit takes place, so there will be time to implement any changes required to adjust our business to the new environment. 'Morgan Stanley will continue to monitor developments very closely and will adapt accordingly while prioritising the interests of our clients, our shareholders and our employees,' the spokesman added.  British fund manager Neil Woodford, who looks after more than £14billion of savers' cash, played down fears over the impact of Brexit – and said the fall in the pound would result in a 'windfall' for exporters.Stock markets in Europe fared far worse than the FTSE with Frankfurt down 6.8 per cent, Paris 8 per cent and Milan and Madrid more than 12 per cent. Sterling stabilised after early trading falls. At one point, the pound was down more than 10 per cent to a 31-year low of $1.3232. But it was later trading at around $1.37, down 8 per cent.As fears over the economy wiped more than £20billion off the value of Britain's biggest banks, David Buik, an analyst at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said: 'We are seeing the results of the apocalyptic hysteria whipped up by the Establishment. 'They are responsible for a large portion of the fall in the value of the pound and share prices.'Bank of England governor Mark Carney pledged to pump an extra £250billion of emergency funds into the financial system. In a sign the central bank could cut interest rates in coming months, he said: 'The Bank will not hesitate to take additional measures as required as markets adjust and the UK economy moves forward.'Analysts said the Bank could cut rates to zero in the coming months having frozen them at 0.5 per cent since March 2009.

PM turns to Chipping Norton chum (and famed diplomat) Jeremy Clarkson to rescue his ailing Remain campaign2016-6-16David Cameron tried to kick his flagging referendum campaign into top gear this morning by appearing alongside his old friend Jeremy Clarkson.Clarkson, together with James May, met the Prime Minister at TV studios in West London where he is making his new motoring show for Amazon.With just a week left of the referendum campaign, Mr Cameron is staring at the prospect of humiliating defeat as almost all polls show Brexit is ahead.Clarkson, a controversial figure after his sacking from the BBC last year, surprised many by endorsing the campaign to stay in the European Union.But he joked today staying inside the EU was one of just three things he and and fellow former Top Gear host May agreed on.David Cameron shared coffee and croissants with James May, left, and Jeremy Clarkson, right, today as the trio discussed the referendum battle Mr Cameron met with the two TV stars at the TV studios they own together with producer Andy Wilman to work on the new project with Amazon Clarkson said to the PM: 'It's an extraordinary thing that James and I only agree on three things, which is sandwich spread is delicious, the old Subaru Legacy Outback is a good car and Britain staying in.'During an informal talk with Mr Cameron over cappuccinos in Stronger In-branded mugs and croissants, Clarkson added: 'I have not, with the greatest of respect, heard one politician say anything that's caused me to change my mind.'There's huge numbers that don't understand and get confused. Really, it's my gut.'Clarkson said he felt there were 'compelling' reasons for leaving.But, he added: 'They're not compelling enough for me to say I want to drive a Morris Oxford, which is what would happen.'Clarkson has famously insulted many countries - on one occasion getting into hot water for suggesting the first German-built Mini had turn signals that looked like a Nazi salute.The biggest diplomatic incident triggered by the presenter focused on Argentina when he was accused of driving a car with an offensive number plate.Despite his frequent gaffes, Clarkson is an enthusiastic European - once hosting an entire TV series dedicated to a driving tour of the continent. May said: 'If I'm honest, it's a gut feeling for me as well.'There are too many people who think we will be alright... but that's just not true.'Mr Cameron turned up with branded Britain Stronger in Europe mugs to try and reinforce his campaignThe pair discussed the effects of Brexit on the UK car industry and Mr Cameron said manufacturers would face tariffs on exports to the continent in the event of vote to leave.He said: 'I've spent a lot of time in different car plates in the last few years and if you look at Toyota, Nissan, Jaguar, Ford they are all doing well in Britain.'They are all expanding, they are all making more, they are all selling more and if we were out - like America was out and with a trade deal like them - they would actually face a tariff on every single car they send to Europe.'Clarkson added that his fellow presenter Richard Hammond was filming in France for the trio's new Amazon Prime show and was still undecided on how to vote.'He is a don't know - he does not actually know there's a referendum on,' he joked.In his previous declaration for Remain, Clarkson said it would be 'better to stay in and try to make the damn thing work properly'.He wrote in the Sunday Times: 'Britain, on its own, has little influence on the world stage. I think we are all agreed on that.'But Europe, if it were well run and had cohesive, well thought-out policies, would be a tremendous force for good.'Mr Cameron and Clarkson live close to each in Oxfordshire and the PM offered support to his friend when he lost his job at the BBC's Top Gear for punching a producer.Clarkson and May, together with Richard Hammond, are currently working on a new motoring show for the Amazon TV streaming service.The trio set plans in motion for the new show following Clarkson's sacking and The Grand Tour is due to air later this year.The third part of the motoring trio, Richard Hammond, was said to be absent filming and completely unaware of the fact the referendum was taking place Both Clarkson, left, and May, right, are both firm supporters of the Remain campaign and greeted the PM at the W Chump and Sons TV studios today The Prime Minister is due to take his campaign to Gibraltar later today in a further bid to prop up the campaign.But he arrived to calls from Leave advocate Liam Fox to give a clear signal of support for The Rock whatever the result next week.Mr Fox said: 'The PM must make clear that whatever the referendum result the UK will fully back the sovereignty and security of Gibraltar.'The message must be completely unequivocal. 'The people of Gibraltar are owed nothing less. 'This is one place where 'Project Fear' would be wholly irresponsible.'Gibraltar's successful economy is based on tourism, shipping, financial services and online games.'All would benefit from a free market without the supremacy of EU law and the regulations imposed by Brussels.' 

It was just unfortunate timing! Nigel Farage insists he DIDN'T pull his 'racist' poster on immigration because it was slammed by all sides but only because the referendum was paused after the killing of Jo Cox2016-6-20Nigel Farage today claimed he only withdrew a poster branded 'racist' by critics because of the 'unfortunate timing' of its publication just two hours before the killing of MP Jo Cox.The Ukip leader repeated his dismissal of cross-party condemnation of the poster, which feature a column of thousands of refugees and migrants trying to walk into Europe through Slovenia. Mr Farage today insisted he had published a similar poster in May and said the image - headlined 'breaking point' - was a fair comment on the pressures faced by the 'Schengen' borderless zone on the continent.The Remain campaign issued cross-party condemnation of the poster within minutes of its publication last Thursday morning and senior Leave campaigner Michael Gove led new criticism yesterday as he admitted it had made him 'shudder'.But Mr Farage today stood by his defence of the poster - hours after insisting he was himself the 'victim' of hatred.Nigel Farage, pictured today at the BBC, has played down the row over Ukip's 'Breaking Point' immigration poster insisting was a victim of bad timing and not a real row Mr Farage, pictured unveiling his controversial poster on Thursday, today said it had been 'unfortunate timing' but insisted the poster made valid argumentsThe Ukip leader told the BBC today: 'I released a very similar poster in the first week of May ahead of the London elections to no comment at all.'This poster, which shows what happened in Europe within the Schengen zone last year, after Mrs Merkel made one of the most irresponsible policy decisions of modern times - one that didn't just affect Germany but affected the whole of the Schengen zone, which effectively is leading to Schengen breaking up - fences being erected and panic movements of people, and that's what we saw on that poster, people crossing.'The EU is failing us all, that's the slogan, and the point is there's been too little debate in this referendum about this union that we're a member of. Mr Farage said the image was not 'invented' and had been on many front pages last year. And he added: 'We planned to run six posters in the last week of the campaign. This poster was designed for the day.'It was unfortunate timing that within a couple of hours of releasing it, this terrible tragic murder took place, and when we saw that, we immediately withdrew the poster, because we understood that it was a day for everybody to go quiet and be silent.'Even discussing immigration with some people is deeply offensive. I've been doing this for years - I've been laughed at, I've been ridiculed, I've been condemned, I've been demonised, but the point is this.'We're members of a political union that is failing, and we get the knock on effects of much of it. The central point of this campaign is we want to control our country, and part of that is controlling our borders.'Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr that he 'shuddered' when he saw the Ukip poster on immigration when it was unveiled last weekChancellor George Osborne joined the chorus of condemnation and said the Ukip poster had 'echoes' of 1930s literatureJustice Secretary Mr Gove yesterday revealed he 'shuddered' when Ukip unveiled an anti-immigration poster featuring refugees just a week before the EU referendum.Nigel Farage has come under fire for suggesting Britain is at 'breaking point' with a poster of refugees - despite the fact none of them have the right to come to Britain.The Ukip leader was told today his attack was flawed because Britain was not a member of the Schengen borderless zone in Europe.The Schengen area includes 22 of the 28 EU countries and means there are no border or passport controls - allowing people to travel between countries without stopping.But Britain is one of the countries with a specific opt out meaning legal travel across the UK border needs a passport or other form of ID. Mr Farage has insisted the poster reflects how the EU is failing all countries in Europe, including Schengen members, not just Britain. The Justice Secretary said the poster, branded racist by critics, was the 'wrong thing to do'. Mr Osborne, who supports the Remain campaign, also condemned the poster today as having 'echoes' of far right literature from the 1930s.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and Brexit-backing Labour MP John Mann all slammed the poster in interviews yesterday.Mr Gove said: 'When I saw that poster, I shuddered. I felt it was the wrong thing to do.'I must stress, I believe in free speech, I don't want to deny anyone a platform, and when I have had the opportunity to talk about migration during the course of this debate.'I hope I have been very clear I am pro-migration but the way in which we secure public support for the continued benefits migration brings, the way we secure public support for helping refugees in need is if people feel they can control the numbers overall coming here.'Chancellor George Osborne, who supports the Remain campaign, also condemned the poster today as having 'echoes' of far right literature from the 1930s.Mr Farage unveiled the controversial poster on Thursday, exactly a week before the EU referendum but was immediately condemned for the toneMr Osborne told ITV's Peston on Sunday: 'I think there is a difference between addressing those concerns [about immigration] in a reasonable way and whipping up concerns, whipping up division, making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey, or saying that dead bodies are going to wash up on the beaches of Kent – or, indeed, putting up that disgusting and vile poster that Nigel Farage did which had echoes of literature used in the 1930s.'That is what we should say no to and this referendum vote is a vote on the kind of Britain we want.'Mr Farage yesterday rejected the charge of stoking up hatred, telling ITV interviewer Robert Peston: 'I think I have been a politician who has been a victim of it, to be honest with you.'When you challenge the establishment in this country, they come after you, they call you all sorts of things.'We saw the Chancellor a few minutes ago - despite the fact that overnight he talked about turning down the rhetoric - doing the same thing again.'Asked if he wished he hadn't unveiled the poster, Mr Farage replied: 'I wish an innocent Member of Parliament hadn't been gunned down on the street.'That's the point, and frankly had that not happened, I don't think we would have had the kind of row that we've had over it.'He added: 'There was a big momentum developing right across the country, [then] a tragic death... It's difficult to see where either of the campaigns go.'Despite his criticism of the Ukip poster, Mr Gove defended the official Vote Leave campaign's claims about immigration and particularly the possibility of Turkey joining the EU Mr Farage said: 'That poster reflects the truth of what's going on. We have a new poster coming out tomorrow morning and we'll unveil a new poster for every day.'Mr Gove defended the claims on immigration made by his own campaign about Turkey, insisting it was not wrong to ensure migrant numbers are controlled.Interviewed by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Gove was challenged on Vote Leave leaflets which claim Turkey's high birth rate would mean a million more people having the right to come to Britain.Mr Gove said: 'I think it is important to stress that when we are thinking about the enlargement of the European Union - and it is the official policy of the EU to accelerate Turkey's accession.'I think the fact that both the British government and the EU want Turkey and other countries to join is clear. The rate and speed at which Turkey will join will depend on a variety of political factors.'But it is the case that during the course of this year the EU want to accelerate that process and I think that when Turkey is becoming less democratic that is not the right thing to do.'Mr Gove denied discussion of Turkey's birth rate made him 'queasy' and added: 'I think it is very important when we are talking about migration to take into account numbers overall as well.'One of the things about numbers is that we benefit from migration if the numbers are controlled.' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today admitted he did not believe there could be limits placed on free movement in the EU as he claimed the Government was at fault for not giving communities resources to cope Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon yesterday renewed her criticism of the Ukip poster.She told Sky News: 'In these last few days I hope we can have a debate that doesn't focus on immigration.'Yes, people's concerns about immigration need to be addressed, but let's also make the positive case for a world and a Europe where we all have the freedom of travel and the positive case for immigration and the benefits that brings to our economy.'On that point, the poster that Nigel Farage unveiled last week was vile and racist and I hope he does agree today to withdraw that poster, because that kind of sentiment has no place in a civilised debate.' 

Will your nanny, cleaner or builder have to leave the UK? EU workers fear they may have to leave Britain after Brexit shock2016-6-24Eastern European immigrants living in the UK say they fear for their futures after the Brexit shock.The country's three million non-British EU citizens, many of whom are cooks, cleaners and builders, say they are 'stunned' by the referendum - and may reconsider their plans to stay in Britain.At Warsaw's Modlin airport in Poland today migrants boarding flights back to London said they are 'scared' by the prospect of Britain out of the EU. Shock': NHS Occupational Therapist Agata Farquherson, 30, from Lublin, was among those flying back to Britain from Warsaw's Modlin airport today in the wake of the result. She has lived in London for 10 years and said: 'I am shocked and very disappointed. It's a very bad day'Shock: Farquherson is among three million non-British EU workers living in the UK, of those 850,000 are Polish. Those visiting family back home said a Brexit is their worst nightmare and facing uncertain futuresTadeusz Kaminski, 31, from the Polish capital Warsaw but working as a baker in Sunderland since 2011 told Mailonline: 'I am completely shocked. I knew it would be close but I didn't really think Britain would vote out.'I think it's a very bad idea. I have been living in England for five years. I will have to think very hard about my future now.'I don't even know if I'll have a future in the UK anymore.Marta, 34, another Pole visiting family in Warsaw who works for a Brighton-based catering company, told Mailonline: 'This is the worst thing that could happen.'I am really scared now. I am scared for my family in England. My son goes to school there my husband is Polish and works for the city council. We have our lives there.'Now I don't know what will happen. Will we be forced to leave?'I have been in England for four years. We went there for a better life, better money, a better education for our son.'This vote could destroy all that. That's why I'm afraid.'NHS Occupational Therapist  Agata Farquherson, 30, originally from Lublin, Poland, but has been living in London for 10 years. She told MailOnline: 'I am shocked and very disappointed. I am now worried about the NHS as most of the people who work there are foreigners. If they have to leave it will be catastrophic.'I don't know how it will affect me personally. I got married last week but I don't have British citizenship. Not yet.'Perhaps I will try and get it. Some of my Polish friends were applying for it in the lead up to the vote.'A lot of people are quite afraid of what will happen. They have built their lives in the UK and now what?'My husband voted remain, but his parents, my in-laws, voted leave. That created some problems.'I wouldn't say this vote is destroying lives and relationships but it could easily turn in to that.' When Poland and many other Eastern European countries joined the EU 12 years ago, some 850,000 Poles jumped at the chance of working in Britain.  Devastated: Latvian Irina Knazeva, 26, who lives in Hammersmith told MailOnline: 'I thought the result would be to remain, and now that David Cameron has resigned I'm even more heartbroken'Residency: The Eastern European Advice Centre said it had been flooded by non-Brish EU workers applying for British citizenship and permanent residence documents in the weeks and months before the referendumConcerns: Of Brexit Tadeusz Kaminski, said: 'It's a very bad idea. I have lived in England for five years. I will have to think hard about my future now. I don't even know if I'll have a future in the UK anymore'Now London-based Eastern European Advice Centre said it has been flooded by applications for British citizenship and permanent residence documents.The leave campaign gave unequivocal assurances a new immigration system would not affect the three million non-British EU citizens already in the country. Under British law, immigrants who have lived in the UK for more than five years can apply for permanent residency.The Polish Institute of International Affairs, a Warsaw-based think tank, estimates that still leaves between 120,000 to 400,000 Poles who arrived after 2012.The rights of those EU citizens living in the UK are not guaranteed and will be part of the negotiation with Europe following Brexit.Britain already has an Australian-style points system to stop uncontrolled numbers from outside the EEA coming to Britain.The tier two visa system is the main route for visa applicants and operates on a points system similar to that of Australia with salary, English language fluency and other factors scored.After five years of continuous residency, visa holders can apply for the permanent right to remain in the country.Now it is almost certain that non-British citizens who had the right to live and work in the UK will need documentation to prove their rights to stay. 'Anger': Mother-of-one Gabriela Rydzik, 36, a Pole living in Richmond, west London, said: 'It's devastating for all us Poles. We were hoping for a different result. But now nobody knows what will happen'Scared: Marta, 34, a Pole visiting family in Warsaw who lives in Brighton, told Mailonline: 'This is the worst thing that could happen. 'I am really scared now. I am scared for my family in England'Damian, 39, who comes from the Polish city of Lodz but has been working as a factory supervisor in Croydon for eight years said: 'They were whipped into a fever over immigration, as if that was the only issue at stake. 'People became afraid of us. It's too early to say what I'll do. I'm still stunned by it.'I'll be in Poland for a week and will see how the situation develops. I don't want to leave Britain. It's my home. But perhaps I'll have no choice other than to leave.'He added: 'The immigration issue has basically turned us into villains. But what people don't seem to realise is that if you're part of a common market you have free movement of people.'That's the same for Brits living in Europe too. What's going to happen to all of them living and working in France, Germany, Italy, etc?'Monika Cyrek, a Polish national who works in a grocery store run by her mother that sells mostly Polish products, said: 'If we're not wanted here, probably a lot of people will leave and try other places.' And Romanian Raluca Cioroianu, a farm shop manager in Addlestone, Surrey, said: 'I came here with good intentions, to work, to pay taxes, to improve my knowledge, my culture, and to make a better life.'Latvian Irina Knazeva, 26, from Hammersmith, west London, I feel heartbroken. I thought the result would be to remain, and now that David Cameron has resigned I'm even more heartbroken. He supported British people in the European Union until the end. Fearful: Monika Cyrek, a Polish national who works in a grocery store run by her mother that sells mostly Polish products, said: 'If we're not wanted here, probably a lot of people will leave and try other places'Proud to be Romanian: Raluca Cioroianu is a farm shop manager in Addlestone. She said: 'I came here with good intentions, to work, to pay taxes, to improve my knowledge, my culture, and to make a better life'Mother-of-one Gabriela Rydzik, 36, a Pole living in Richmond, west London, is an account manager market for research company. She said: 'It's devastating for all us Poles. We were hoping for a different result. But now nobody knows what will happen. We hoped that in the modern world we would break down walls not build new ones. But many of us have British citizenship. I've been here for thirteen years, and now I have citizenship. I brought my family here and they do too – apart from my mother who helps look after my daughter. Now this is an additional obligation.' Cambridge PhD student Joy Muraszko, 26, is half-Polish and half-British. Originally from Warsaw she has been living in Cambridge for three years.Damian, 39, who comes from the Polish city of Lodz but has been working as a factory supervisor in Croydon for eight years said: 'They were whipped into a fever over immigration, as if that was the only issue at stake'Unease: The rights of those EU citizens living in the UK, particularly the 400,000 or so Poles who arrived after 2012, are not guaranteed and will be part of the negotiation with Europe following BrexitShe told MailOnline: 'I am very unhappy about the result. It's a disaster. I saw the results coming in last night and when I woke up this morning I just couldn't believe it.'It will certainly affect me because my PhD is funded by the European Union. I'm thinking about leaving, but I don't know where I would go. It's a very bad day.'Poland's Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said this morning that Poland would stay a key ally of Britain despite the vote to leave. He told Polish Radio: 'Britain was, is and will remain an ally in several areas that have not changed.'On questions of security, Europe. Britain will remain in NATO, will remain a transatlantic country that links Europe with the United States. Here, as our ally, that will not change.'He added: 'But of course Britain, leaving the EU, will stop being our ally in a certain concept of the development of the EU because it will no longer take part in decisions.' By Ed Wight in Warsaw, Poland, for MailonlineHundreds and thousands of Poles could end up applying for full British citizenship following Britain's exit from the EU.Jakub Krupa, the head of Poles in UK, an umbrella organisation that works with Polish groups in Britain, and the London correspondent for Polish news agency PAP warned that many Polish people who live in the UK could end up staying as they treated Britain as their home.Mr Krupa told MailOnline: 'I would expect many Poles who have lived here for five-six years or longer to apply for a permanent residence or even a UK citizenship in the following months in a bid to curb the potential risks.'From what we know, a significant majority of Poles living here think of the UK as their home, and will be willing to stay, unless exposed to a vast number of new life-troubling admin procedures or social hostility towards them they fear of.'He added: 'I think both the interim Cameron administration and the new Brexit cabinet will have an important task to make sure they [Poles] still feel welcome in the UK, so that they feel convinced about their place in the cosmopolitan vision of post-Brexit Britain as presented by Boris and Michael Gove.'Surely that would be much appreciated and seen as an important gesture and a good starting point for strong partnership even outside of the EU the historically close relations between both nations (Battle of Britain, Polish Government in Exile etc.).'Last week, a poll conducted online by The Institute of Market and Social Research from Warsaw (IBRIS in Polish) showed that many Poles in the UK were afraid of Brexit.The survey, which was carried out between 15 June and 17 June showed that of the 5,878 Poles living in the UK who took part, 61 percent felt uncertain with 10.5 percent saying they were afraid.When asked where they saw their future, a whopping 83.3 percent said the United Kingdom.And when asked what would they do if Britain voted out, 47.4 percent said they would 'Want to stay whatever the cost.'Just 3.0 per cent said they would definitely go back to Poland, while 9.6 percent responded they would migrate to another EU country.The poll concluded that 'as many as 83% see their future as the Queen's subjects. The percentage of those who would like to return to Poland is minimal (3 per cent).'It added: 'What's worth noting, potentially limited access to benefit systems does not bother the respondents too much (11.9 per cent).'Our research also reveals that Poles living in the UK are concerned about a potential increase in negative attitudes towards migrant following a Brexit vote (39.2 per cent). While the feel personally accepted in the UK (72.7 per cent net positive), they feel that Poles as a national group are much less welcome (34.6 per cent).'Regardless of the result of Thursday's vote, Poles living in the UK feel integrated with the British society and want to stay in the country, thinking of it as their home. Contrary to the media narrative, access to benefits is nowhere close to their key concerns as almost 94 per cent of them are in permanent employment or education.'

Schools 'could face an extra 570,000 pupils from the EU by 2030': Vote Leave warn of huge classroom swell brought on by new member states joining2016-6-22British schools face an influx of 261,000 children from the EU if Remain wins, Brexit campaigners claimed last night.Vote Leave warned the figure could swell to 571,000 by 2030 if all five states up for EU membership – Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey – join in the near future.Priti Patel, a Tory cabinet minister, said the extra demand would put pressure on already 'overstretched' schools.British schools face an influx of 261,000 children from the EU if Remain wins, Brexit campaigners claimed last night. Vote Leave warned the figure could swell to 571,000 by 2030 if all five states up for EU membership – Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey – join in the near futureAs the referendum campaign headed into its final day:Vote Leave said the increase in school-age European nationals was likely to add between £1billion and £1.9billion to the cost of the UK's annual education budget by 2030.The campaign calculates that between 2000 and 2014, some 152,000 school-age migrants came to the UK from other EU countries.David Cameron’s former adviser refused to back down last night as the PM refuted claims he was warned four years ago it was ‘impossible’ to keep his net migration promises while Britain remained in the EU.The PM insisted his former closest adviser Steve Hilton was ‘simply not right’ and that immigration had been falling in 2012 when the adviser said reducing its level from hundreds of thousands every year to ‘tens of thousands’ would never be hit.But Mr Hilton – who made his claims in yesterday’s Mail – stuck to his guns. He said he had been in No 10 when officials delivered ‘projections that showed there was no way we could meet the target within the EU’.Justice Secretary Michael Gove backed Mr Hilton last night. He said: ‘Making promises and then saddling yourself with a political union that means you cannot deliver those promises doesn’t contribute to an atmosphere of trust in politics.’In 2014 alone, the figure stood at 25,000. This is a seven-fold increase on the 3,000 children who came in 2004 – the year Poland and seven other Eastern European countries joined the EU.A continued annual influx of this size would require the equivalent of about 27 new average-sized secondary schools – or 100 primary schools.The number of school-age children with one or more parent from a non-UK European nation has more than doubled from 309,000 in 2007 to 699,000, said Vote Leave.Based on its own estimates of future immigration if the UK remains in the EU, the campaign group calculated that at least a further 261,000 could join the school system over the coming 15 years – or as many as 571,000 if the union expands.Miss Patel said: 'The EU is undemocratic and interferes too much in our daily lives.'We have seen that with the scale of migration, and the impact this has had on local communities – and key public services such as the NHS, housing and schools.'With more countries waiting to join the EU, including Albania, Serbia, and Turkey – and with British taxpayers paying almost £2billion to help them join – this problem can only get worse.'The warning on Europe's borders came from Sebastian Kurz, Austria's foreign minister.Priti Patel (pictured), a Tory cabinet minister, said the extra demand would put pressure on already 'overstretched' schools'The fact is that we have lost control,' said Mr Kurz. 'At the moment it is not us as the EU that is deciding who comes into Europe, it is the people smugglers.'Mr Kurz, who is a conservative, said the only way to tackle the crisis was to stop accepting illegal arrivals. They should instead be taken away to camps in Africa or elsewhere.The number of EU citizens granted UK passports has surged by 29 per cent in a year in the run-up to the referendum.In 2015, some 12,970 EU nationals had citizenship applications rubber-stamped by the Home Office, up from 10,071 in 2014. It was also a rise from 7,406 in 2011, or 75 per cent. EU citizens have full rights to live and work here, but experts said there was anecdotal evidence that concerns about Brexit had fuelled a spike in citizenship applications.An academic said EU migrants who lived in the UK and had married British citizens would want their status ‘nailed down’.In a bid to regain the initiative on migration, Mr Cameron last night claimed that if Britain votes Remain he would push for more reform of freedom of movement rules.'Reform doesn't end on June 23, the voice of reform will be strengthened, because we will have had a referendum,' he said. However, George Osborne has already ruled out any significant changes – such as imposing a brake on the numbers coming in.In a series of interviews, the PM accused Leave campaigners of stoking division and intolerance.He said all sides of the Out campaign had 'become very narrowly focused' on the issue of immigration and warned that the decision could have consequences.'I've always believed that we have to be able to discuss and to debate immigration,' he said. 'But I've always believed that this is an issue that needs careful handling.'We are talking to a country that has a lot of people who have fled persecution and contribute a massive amount to our country. It does need great care.'Describing the UK as 'arguably the most successful, multi-ethnic, multi-faith, opportunity democracy anywhere on earth', Mr Cameron told the Guardian a Remain vote would send 'a very clear message that we've rejected this idea that Britain is narrow and insular and inward-looking'.More than 100,000 students a year from outside Europe are failing to go home after finishing their courses, a report reveals.Between 2010 and 2013 the influx of non-EU students averaged 156,000 a year, the report published by think-tank MigrationWatch, based on Office for National Statistics figures, showed. But between 2012 and 2015, when they would have been expected to graduate, an average of 46,000 a year left – an annual difference of 110,000.Some will take legitimate jobs, be given permission to settle here with a partner or pursue further studies. But tens of thousands exploit a lax visa system to stay unlawfully.Wolfgang Schäuble, the powerful German finance minister, said he sympathised with British voters who want to leave the European Union and its 'self- regarding' leadership that has gone 'too far' and lost touch with voters across the continent.He said: 'Perhaps we didn't understand quite correctly, and it's led to an excessive level of self-regard in the institutions and apparatuses in Brussels and Luxembourg.'Perhaps we went too far and to some extent lost contact with our citizens.' Ministers yesterday made a last-ditch bid to deport an Italian killer allowed to stay in Britain by ‘dangerous’ EU rules.The 58-year-old, who was granted anonymity by the courts, killed his flatmate and was sentenced to eight years for manslaughter at the Old Bailey in 2002. After his release, the Home Office tried to deport him, but he appealed, sparking a decade-long legal farce.Tory justice minister and prominent Leave campaigner Dominic Raab slammed EU diktats on removing foreign offenders as ‘dangerous and undemocratic’.The Supreme Court yesterday heard submissions from lawyers for Home Secretary Theresa May. A ruling is expected later this year.Dangerous criminals including rapists, killers and paedophiles are able to move freely into Britain because of failures in data-sharing among European nations, a study has found.The report by academics at De Montfort University in Leicester said ‘significant barriers’ existed to information exchange across EU borders.These included differing definitions of sex attackers and violent thugs and ‘problematic’ access to conviction data.Campaigners will seize on the research as evidence that Britain can regain control of its borders only by quitting the EU.

We immediately requested that they stop doing so.'It has since come to light that the Vote Leave campaign continue to use our logo and trademark despite our repeated requests for them to stop.'Permission to use our name and logo was not requested. If it was, it would not have been granted. 'Furthermore, use of the Nissan name and logo by the Vote Leave campaign in their materials grossly misrepresents our widely circulated and publicly stated position announced on 23rd February 2016.'To be clear, Nissan is not supporting any political campaign regarding this most serious of issues.

Results out over the weekend revealed a tie, Remain leads of up to 3 per cent and Leave leads of 2% Boris Johnson returned to the campaign trail at Ipswich firm Trucks R Us today as he urged voters to seize their chance to 'change the course of European history' by endorsing Brexit on Thursday Mr Johnson said a Remain vote would do nothing to 'rebuke the elites in Brussels' or allow Britain to set up a trade deal with America, China or India. And in a clear dismissal of Mr Cameron - who just last night insisted Britain was better in the room, at the negotiating table, Mr Johnson said: 'We are not more powerful, or more influential for being around the table in Brussels.'Look at the pitiful results of the so-called renegotiation earlier this year. We are drowned out.Nobel laureates from around the world have urged voters to back staying in the EU in Thursday's referendum, warning of long-lasting economic damage after a vote to leave. With just three days to go until voters finally go to the polls to decide the future of Britain's EU membership, 10 Nobel-prize laureates in the world of economics claimed Brexit would 'create major uncertainty about Britain's alternative future trading arrangements'. The leading professors said the UK's trading relationships with the rest of Europe, north American and China would be put in jeopardy if Britain leaves the EU. Writing in a letter to the Guardian today, they write: 'These effects, though one-off, would persist for many years. 'Thus the economic arguments are clearly in favour of remaining in the EU,' the 10 Nobel-prize winners conclude. However economics laureate Christopher Pissarides said today that the outcome of Thursday's historic referendum could come down to the failure of the Remain campaign to explain what's at stake for Britain and the wider world. He said the impact of a Brexit vote would have much far-reaching consequences than people had so far warned. 'The impact from a Brexit will be worse than most people think and it's partly the failure of the campaign to remain to point it out,' Pissarides warned. 'When you have a process that started 60 years ago and then suddenly you reverse - it will not be a temporary glitch, it is going to be a massive bump,' he added. 'And it is an illusion to think that if we vote to Remain, we are somehow opting for the status quo. 'The status quo is not on offer. If we stay in, we will be engaged willy-nilly in the desperate attempt to keep the euro together, by building an economic government of Europe.'Mr Johnson said he wanted to hand 'power back to the people' because democracy was the 'best way of correcting the errors of our people'.He said: 'Now is the time to believe in ourselves, and in what Britain can do, and to remember that we always do best when we believe in ourselves.'Of course we can continue to provide leadership and support for Europe – but inter-governmentally, outside the supranational EU system.'I hope you will vote Leave, and take back control of this great country's destiny; and if we Vote Leave, then all our votes will count for more in the future.'This chance will not come again in our lifetimes, and I pray we do not miss it.'Mr Johnson will again be joined by Labour's Gisela Stuart and Tory Andrea Leadsom when he takes to the Wembley Arena stage tomorrow night.For the Remain side, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and TUC chief Frances O'Grady.In his final live TV event last night, Mr Cameron recalled Winston Churchill as he pleaded with voters to back him on Thursday. He said: 'In my office I sit two yards away from the Cabinet Room where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler - the best and greatest decision perhaps anyone's ever made in our country, right?'He didn't want to be alone, he wanted to be fighting with the French and with the Poles and the others, but he didn't quit.'He didn't quit in Europe, he didn't quit on European democracy, he didn't quit on European freedom.'We want to fight for these things today and you can't win, you can't fight if you're not in the room.

It's not an easy decision.'When I look at the people who are now saying the things they are saying and the people who are supporting that approach, the BNP, Donald Trump, Marine le Pen, Austria's Freedom Party — every day it feels like the far right is coming out to stand by Leave.' She later told the BBC: 'This kind of nudge-nudge, wink-wink xenophobic racist campaign may be politically savvy or politically useful in the short term, but it causes long-term damage to communities.'The vision that me and other Brexiters who have been involved right from the outset, who had a positive outward-looking vision of what a Brexit vote might mean, unfortunately those voices have now been stifled.'What we see is the divisive campaign which has resulted in people like me and others who are deeply Eurosceptic and want to see a reformed relationship feel that they now have to leave Leave.'But a spokesman for Vote Leave said the campaign was confused by Lady Warsi's announcement.He said: 'We don't remember Warsi ever joining our campaign so we are puzzled by her claims to have defected.'Daniel Hannan, the high profile Tory MEP and Leave campaigner, said: 'When I invited Sayeeda Warsi to join the Leave campaign, she declined. Fair enough, obviously. But how is this a 'defection'?'Tory MP Bernard Jenkin added: 'I helped set up Vote Leave and she has not been at a single meeting I have attended. ''Defects'' just not accurate!.'

And it will take some time for the United Kingdom to establish new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world.' The markets began to shudder after the first bombshell result in Sunderland at around 1am, which far exceeded expectations in the Leave camp, provoked fierce new jitters in the City. The pound immediately plunged three per cent after the Sunderland result and at 2am was more than five per cent off against the dollar. The market rebounded some of the lost ground after Wandsworth voted strongly for Remain. But at around 3.30am as expectations of a Brexit vote grew and it became the bookies favourite for the first time, Sterling dropped like a stone. The Bank of England has said it will take 'all necessary steps' to ensure monetary and financial stability in the wake of the Brexit vote.In a statement issued following Britain's referendum on the European Union, the Bank said: 'The Bank of England is monitoring developments closely.'It has undertaken extensive contingency planning and is working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks.

Carney offered some reassurance to a market desperate for it, and cable is back through 1.38.'The next head to roll is likely to be Osborne, but it's unlikely to give the pound any more impetus - a recovery through 1.40 seems very unlikely at this stage.

Risk currencies (Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen) would benefit, but policy responses could limit the degree of strength quickly.' 'The world's first DIY recession?' Top fund manager warns investors to brace themselves as pound crashes and shares tumble on UK's seismic vote to split with EU One of Britain's leading fund managers has forecast that the UK will enter the 'world's first DIY recession' off the back of its Brexit vote.The stock market tumbled and the pound crashed 8 per cent to $1.38 against the dollar in response to the UK's seismic referendum vote to leave the EU, plunging the City and financial markets into turmoil. 'The biggest sadness of today is that it is reasonable to assume that the UK will quickly enter a period of economic recession, the key reason why we believed the outcome would be different from what has materialised today, said Richard Buxton, veteran fund manager and head of equities at Old Mutual.'It is, in effect, likely to be the first ever 'DIY recession', as George Osborne prophetically called it,'Shock result: Leave campaigners won a seismic vote for the UK to leave the EUThe FTSE 100 stock market index initially opened 7 per cent down as nervous investors ditched shares that they had bought as the market bet big on Remain in the run up to the vote, but it was off the worst lows after the first hour of trading.By 9.45am the Footsie was down 3.9 per cent at 6,091.3 - a steep fall but only back to where it was on 4 January, the first trading day of 2016, when it closed at 6,093.4.Sterling was down a less sharp 6 per cent against the euro to €1.24, as the fallout from the historic split will be felt directly in Europe as well as the UK. The shock result saw the pound plummet to a 31-year low of $1.35 at one point this morning, and currency markets are expected to enter a period of extreme volatility until the UK's new terms of trade with its ex-EU partners become clear. Britain's most famous fund manager Neil Woodford said: 'This clearly represents a very significant decision for the UK, for the European Union and indeed for the wider global economy. Markets are clearly shocked by the decision but, in our view, it is not as negative a development as the market's initial reaction appears to imply.'We have been clear in our thinking on the economic implications of Brexit for some time. The independent report that we commissioned on the subject (if you haven't read it, please do, particularly if you need reassuring on what this decision is likely to mean for the economy), concluded that Britain's long-term economic future would be largely unaffected by a decision to leave the European Union. We stand by these conclusions.'That is not to say there won't be challenges in the near-term. There will. We now face a period of uncertainty as the exact terms of Britain's exit from Europe are negotiated. Financial markets loathe uncertainty as amply demonstrated by this morning's reaction across all asset classes.' Mr Buxton, who has a 30-year investing career and is also chief executive of fund management giant Old Mutual, said that the fallout from the Leave vote could include an interest rate cut, mass stock market selling and even contribute to a US recession.He forecast that British-listed firms with mainly domestic customers and businesses would suffer the most in the sell-off. He said: 'It is difficult to say at this stage what action the Bank of England may take, but it is not impossible to imagine that it may quickly cut interest rates. Restarting the programme of quantitative easing – a feature that has been absent from the economic landscape for some three years now – also looks a possibility. At the very least, the central bank is likely to indicate its preparedness to take such action.'We believe that the prospects for domestically focused UK businesses are clearly the bleakest of all. FTSE multinationals will, on a relative basis, almost certainly perform better than their domestically oriented peers as the weaker pound will support overseas earnings when translated back into sterling.'Nevertheless, investors should now brace themselves for an unpleasant period of relatively indiscriminate selling as funds aim to meet redemptions in conditions where liquidity may be more limited than usual.'In terms of international markets, there seems to be a real possibility that the result could contribute to tipping the US economy into recession.'The result, in our view, also has potentially very serious implications for the future of the European Union itself; a break-up of the broader union has today become a distinctly greater possibility, and we would not be surprised to see amplified calls from, for example, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark to leave the EU.'While the short-term outlook is for volatility, some are more sanguine over the long-term effect of the vote to leave the EU.Peter Elston, chief investment officer, Seneca IM, said: 'It was patently clear from the debate that even those campaigning to leave the EU did not know precisely what a post-Brexit world would look like.'The financial markets are sending a clear message today that it could well be bleak, though that is by no means a certainty. Indeed 52 per cent of the electorate believes that the UK's prospects are now brighter. They and their flag bearers should now be listened to.''After the 1992 devaluation the pound managed to regain all of the ground it lost against Europe's currencies within a couple of years, so it remains to be seen if sterling will remain depressed for long,' said Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell.'However, if there is a prolonged weakness in sterling that could actually help some of the FTSE 100's individual constituents, as around three-quarters of the index's aggregate sales come from overseas. 'Don't panic! Investors urged to stay calm, avoid booking losses and look for fresh opportunities amid market chaos The UK's momentous vote to quit the EU has sparked warnings from investing experts to sit tight and avoid booking losses during the immediate market panic after the shock result.The pound crashed nearly 10 per cent overnight and the FTSE 100 opened 8 per cent or 488 points down at 5,849.9 down after the close 52-48 per cent vote in the EU referendum.'Markets dislike uncertainty and they now face this in spades. However, this is a moment for investors to take a deep breath and focus on their long-term investment goals,' said Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International.Stay calm and carry on: Investor urged not to panic sell and to focus on ong-term goals after vote to quit EU'As hard as it may be right now for investors to remain calm, it is important to remember that market volatility is a normal part of long-term investing and with the benefit of hindsight some of the most turbulent times in stock market history are barely visible on a chart of the market's ups and downs. 'Over time the risk of holding equities is usually rewarded and markets invariably overshoot in both directions.'Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer at TD Direct Investing, said: 'I urge investors not to panic by the initial shock and focus on the longer term because it's never been right to sell at bottom of markets.'The world isn't ending, it's changing with new challenges and opportunities – let's today not forget the opportunities. Markets are forward looking, the dust will settle and investor confidence will return.'Adrian Lowcock, head of investing at AXA Wealth, said: 'Times of uncertainty will knock investor confidence as they see falling share prices and panicked experts predict doom and gloom. This leads to making quick and often irrational decisions, such as selling after the market has fallen.'Companies will adjust and the British economy will adapt. Investors need to look through all the noise and remain focused on their personal goals. Any sell-off will produce opportunities for prudent investors looking at the big picture and focused on the longer term.'A weaker sterling will help the UK become more competitive and could boost the earnings of many of UK's large companies where the bulk of profits are made overseas.'He offer three basic tips for investors: do nothing, review your goals and look for opportunities.Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre, said: 'At a personal level a majority of investors may welcome the result as it meets with the wishes a majority indicated to us in our recent customer surveys. However, it is likely in the short term to result in increased market volatility amid uncertainty over what a vote to leave will mean for the UK.'That negative short-term outlook may soon be reversed for those companies which will benefit from their exports being more competitive or their overseas earnings being more valuable in sterling terms.'Investors will need to be sure-footed in identifying those companies which may benefit from the outcome of the vote and look for opportunities where whole sectors have been written down without any meaningful differentiation between companies to reflect the variation in impact the vote will have. The market will return to valuations based on fundamentals in due course.'Shock result: Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would resign following the Brexit voteJason Hollands, managing director of wealth management group Tilney Bestinvest, said: 'Investors will be looking for words of reassurance and coordinated action from central bankers to demonstrate they have prepared for this eventuality and that they will provide the necessary liquidity to shore up the financial system in the immediate aftermath.'It's also imperative that politicians, in particular the Chancellor, George Osborne, rapidly reign back from some of the recent alarmist campaign rhetoric, to one that is more measured in tone and does not stoke further panic.'Investors are going to need to hold their nerve through the coming days. Although the scale and rapidity of the slide in sterling is enormous, the UK has previously endured sharp devaluations in sterling before, notably following the ejection of the pound from the European Exchange Rate mechanism and in the aftermath of the banking crisis. While painful at the time, both were followed by periods of economic expansion.'

Turks: Cameron's our No1 backer! PM said Turkey wouldn't join the EU until 3000... but they say he is on their side2016-6-22A senior adviser to Turkey’s president last night said David Cameron was his country’s ‘chief supporter’ in its bid to join the European Union.In hugely embarrassing comments for the Prime Minister, Islamic hardliner Recep Erdogan’s top aide said he was shocked to hear Mr Cameron say he did not expect Turkey to join the EU for many years.Ilnur Chevik told BBC2’s Newsnight: ‘We are really flabbergasted! We thought Mr Cameron was our chief supporter for our quest in European Union membership. We felt that when we needed him, he was going to be there.A senior adviser to Turkey’s president last night said David Cameron was his country’s ‘chief supporter’ in its bid to join the European Union‘Turks felt that the British were the driving force behind our EU membership and that they were supporting us right to the hilt. But the way Mr Cameron put it – he didn’t believe anything, apparently, in our full membership. He was only deceiving us and he was just buying time.’Mr Cameron has spent the referendum campaign playing down the prospect of Turkey’s 77 million citizens getting free movement to the UK by joining up. In the first televised referendum debate, on Sky TV, he claimed that Turkey would not become a member of the EU ‘until about the year 3000’.During a later debate, on Question Time, he said: ‘I can’t find a single expert anywhere in the country or in Europe who thinks that Turkey’s going to join the EU in the next three decades.’Asked if he would veto Turkey’s entry, Mr Cameron replied: ‘It’s not going to come up.’Earlier this week, it emerged the British embassy in Ankara had a ‘dedicated team’ working towards securing Turkey’s EU membership.In Turkey two years ago, Mr Cameron said: ‘In terms of Turkish membership of the EU, I very much support that. That’s a long-standing position of British foreign policy which I support.’And in a speech at the Turkish parliament in Ankara in July 2010, Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m here to make the case for Turkey’s membership of the EU. And to fight for it.’Islamic hardliner Recep Erdogan's aide Ilnur Chevik told BBC2’s Newsnight: ‘We are really flabbergasted! We thought Mr Cameron was our chief supporter'In last night’s referendum debate, Labour MP Gisela Stuart said: ‘I would quite like the real David Cameron to step forward and tell us what the real policy on Turkey is.‘On the one hand he tells us [they will join] in the year 3000, or is it now 30 years, and on the other hand we are spending £1.9 billion of your money to accelerate accession of Turkey. Which David Cameron are we to believe?’It came as Mr Cameron was accused of ‘panicking’ after delivering an unexpected address outside No 10, urging older voters to put ‘those who are yet to be born’ first.Leave campaigners said he breached the ‘spirit’ of campaign rules that state he should not take advantage of Government buildings. They said if Mr Cameron wanted to argue the case for Britain staying inside the EU, he should have appeared in last night’s Wembley debate, which he refused to attend.Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘The fact he chose to speak from the No 10 steps without taking a single question shows not only how weak he knows his case to be, but also that he is panicking.’ 

Who'd want to be shackled to an economic catastrophe like this? Thought the Eurozone nightmare was over? You're terrifyingly wrong, says City Editor ALEX BRUMMER. The worst could be yet to come...2016-6-22The ‘Remain’ campaign has tried to scare us to death about the terrible damage which will be done to the British economy if we leave the European Union.What no one has explained, however, is that the majority of our partners in Europe — 19 out of the 28 nations — are members of the eurozone which is delivering an economic catastrophe of historic proportions.Instead, the Remain camp has resorted to talking down the performance of Britain’s economy post-Brexit, without any reference to the parlous state of the eurozone. The more negative the language ‘Project Fear’ has used, the more it damages and confuses businesses and consumers, and the more it therefore becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.In warning citizens of the dangers of a ‘Leave’ vote, the Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have resorted to the most negative forecasts in living memory about the prospects for Britain.Unemployment: Spain (pictured, file image) is now showing signs of recovery, yet youth unemployment there remains staggeringly high at 46 per centCameron has claimed that Brexit would put a ‘bomb’ under the UK economy, and Osborne says that leaving Europe would ‘crash’ the economy.Yet perhaps they should look closer at the economic bloc they are trying to shackle us to. In a harsh new report on the eurozone, the International Monetary Fund says that ‘growing political divisions and Euroscepticism have weakened prospects for collective action, leaving the euro area increasingly vulnerable to a number of risks’.In other words, the home-grown problems of Continental Europe are so serious that the eurozone could be in danger of collapse, irrespective of what happens in this week’s referendum.Unemployment across the region stands at an alarming 10 per cent, more than twice that in Britain. Financial and industrial output in many EU countries has been stagnating or falling for several years.That in turn makes those countries increasingly poor markets for Britain’s exporters. Budget deficits and debt are also piling up in the eurozone, rendering several countries close to bankruptcy.Most dangerous of all, the banking system has been holed below the waterline with an enormous pile of bad debts which are far in excess of the rescue funds set up by Brussels to combat the problem.The truth for Britain is that being part of this deeply flawed market can only harm and worsen our prosperity.Eight years have passed since the worst global financial crisis for a century, and many banks across Europe are so damaged that they are still unable to lend.The International Monetary Fund says that bad loans by the banks — those which are unlikely ever to be paid back — stand at an astonishing €900 billion (£700 billion).The biggest calamity is in Italy, which accounts for the largest amount of rotten lending, with €200 billion (£155 billion) of loans made to companies that are broke. The world’s oldest commercial bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, has been rescued by the authorities at least twice, and is drowning in a sea of festering loans.Near-bankrupt Greek banks are also weighed down with bad loans, and are being kept afloat with cash supplied by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.Even Germany is not immune: the country’s biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, lost €6.7 billion (£5.2 billion) last year. Banks are, of course, the life support system for national economies, providing the loans and the credit needed by business and consumers to support growth.That’s why small businesses in particular have been strangled by the inability of the European banks to serve their needs, which in turn is crushing enterprise, investment and growth.Belatedly, the European Central Bank has sought to re-float the banking system by pumping €40 billion (£31 billion ) of free money into the system each month, in the hope of reviving lending.Yet the massive ‘quantitative easing’ programme is struggling to make any difference at all. Now, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that ‘left unaddressed’, the mounting problems of eurozone banks could lead to ‘systemic risk’ — a posh phrase for Europe-wide collapse.Stagnation: Much of Europe has barely grown in economic terms since the crisis in the single currency erupted in Greece (pictured, May last year) in 2009Much of Europe has barely grown in economic terms since the crisis in the single currency erupted in Greece in 2009. The collapse in output has been especially catastrophic for the people of Greece, who have seen a staggering 27 per cent loss of national wealth despite a series of bail-outs by the IMF, European Central Bank and Brussels. It is by no means alone.Since the launch of the euro in 1999, the Italian economy, the fourth largest in the EU (including the UK) has stagnated and barely grown all.The total increase in output in that time has been just three per cent. To place this in context, Britain’s economy has expanded by 35 per cent over the same period. In France, no significant growth has been seen since 2011.In each of the past five years, output has been negligible at below one per cent, a figure too low to support any new jobs.Enterprise has been crushed by the unreformed labour markets which have sparked a series of damaging recent strikes.And President Hollande’s high taxation has driven tens of thousands of French citizens overseas. As for Germany, in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis it prospered while its euro area neighbours suffered.But the meltdown in the eurozone had a huge long-term impact on German production, because it has not been able to export so many of its costly cars to southern Europe where no one could afford to buy them.The cruellest legacy of the eurozone has been the large-scale unemployment across the 19 member countries (with just a few exceptions). At 10.2 per cent, the average jobless rate across the region is twice that of Britain and the United States. The average disguises huge inequalities across the region, of course.At the bottom of the pile is Greece, where more than a quarter of the workforce is on the dole — placing enormous strains on the benefits system. Even worse, the youth jobless rate stands at 50 per cent, condemning generations of young people to lives of misery.Spain is now showing signs of recovery, yet youth unemployment there remains staggeringly high at 46 per cent. Italy also is badly hurt by a youth unemployment rate of 36.9 per cent, with few prospects of jobs as the economy slumps amid enormous poverty in the poorer southern region, and in Sardinia, one of the most socially deprived areas of the country.France, meanwhile, is struggling to reform its labour laws to make them more flexible, causing angry industrial disputes which have caused nationwide transport chaos.The overall jobless rate remains twice that of the UK. The only big exception in the eurozone is Germany, where an ageing population means there is nearly full employment. Conversely, the shortage of labour in Germany explains the open-door policy Chancellor Angela Merkel extended to migrants from the Middle East and beyond.Fury: Citizens across Europe protest about being left impoverished. Pictured are demonstrators in Portugal where austerity has followed bailouts  Huge, unmanageable budget deficits mean that many of the 19 eurozone countries are in breach of the conditions of EU membership, which restrict government borrowing to 3 per cent of national output. And the downward economic spiral is desperately hard to escape.Low growth means smaller tax revenues and ever-increasing welfare budgets.In contrast to the UK, which is working to balance its budget by 2019-2020, many European governments have no prospect of doing so, thus making their public finances increasingly precarious.IMF figures show that Belgium, home of the EU’s Brussels headquarters, has debts alone which represent 106.8 per cent of the country’s output. In socialist-run France, the debt at 98.2 per cent is almost equal to total wealth, in Spain it’s at 127.9 per cent, in Italy at a whopping 133 per cent, and in Greece at a mammoth 178.4 per cent.The attempts to pay off these massive debts are an ongoing crisis gnawing away at Europe’s future.European data shows that only Britain and Ireland have been expanding their trade with non-EU markets in recent years. Some 44.6 per cent of UK exports still go to the EU, but that is a big drop from 54.8 per cent in 1999. In fact, UK trade with the rest of the world expanded consistently between 1999 and 2014.In contrast, instead of looking outwards to the new digitally connected world, Europe’s trade is increasingly inwardly focused.Data from the EU’s statistics service, Eurostat, shows that more than 62 per cent of the goods exported by EU member states have been to other states within the European bloc.Nationalist: Austerity measures have led to a rise in popularity for the far right, particularly in places like Greece, where the Golden Dawn have seen a surge in membership Germany’s success in selling to its 27 European partners is the source of enormous, destabilising imbalances as it accumulates wealth at the expense of the other countries.But instead of using its vast reserves to assist development and investment among its partners, it has been unforgiving of poor nations in the eurozone, not least in its refusal to allow ailing Greece more time to repay its huge national debts.Even the IMF now says that if membership of the euro area is to become more attractive, greater help must be given to countries with high debt.Germany’s harsh management of the purse strings has been instrumental in the economic dislocation which has fuelled ugly Right-wing movements such as Front National in France, Golden Dawn in Greece, the Freedom Party in Austria and the virulently racist Jobbik party in Hungary.In short, the EU and the eurozone is a club where nothing works and where debts are piled so high that there is virtually no room for any fiscal manoeuvre.Germany is so powerful that no other country can stand up to its control of the levers of power, both in Brussels and through the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, where it is the dominant force.Britain’s exporters voted with their feet and embraced the rest of the world long before this referendum came into view. But then they have little choice.Focusing on trade with a European economic area already shaken to its foundations offers a future of doom and despair. 

It would be 'very very foolish' to impose trade barriers on the UK after Brexit, says German business leader2016-6-22A leading German business figure has warned against imposing trade tariffs on Britain if we leave the EU.Markus Kerber,the head of the BDI - the federation of German industries - said it would be 'very very foolish' to put up such barriers. The remarks have been seized on by the Leave campaign as proof that the UK would get a good deal if we do vote to cut ties tomorrow.Boris Johnson insisted during BBC debate at Wembley Arena last night that EU countries would be 'insane' to impose tariffs, pointing out that a fifth of Germany's car output went to Britain. Boris Johnson, seen on the campaign trail in Ashby de la Zouch today, has seized on the remarks by BDI chief Markus Kerber The bitter referendum battle is entering its final stages, with David Cameron and Boris Johnson crossing the country in a bid to drum up votes.  Mr Kerber urged Germany and the EU to draw up a free-trade regime that could operate after Brexit.He told World Business Report on the BBC's World Service: 'Imposing trade barriers, imposing protectionist measures between our two countries - or between the two political centres, the European Union on the one hand and the UK on the other - would be a very, very foolish thing in the 21st century.'The BDI would urge politicians on both sides to come up with a trade regime that enables us to uphold and maintain the levels of trade we have, although it will become more difficult.'Brexit would be like a relative leaving the family and lead to 'serious disruption' in the German-UK economic relationship, he added.Mr Johnson said today that Germany would be 'desperate' for free trade with Britain if it left the EU. 'After the incessant doom-mongering of the In campaign, we now hear the truth from the "voice of German industry" - that they would be desperate for free trade after we Vote Leave,' he said.'Of course EU countries will continue trading with us on a tariff-free basis - they would be damaging their own commercial interests if they didn't. That's why EU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal on Friday.'As Sir James Dyson said today, this is the last opportunity to regain control of our futures.'If we want to take back control and a more secure and more prosperous future, we have to Vote Leave on June 23.'But the Stronger In campaign stressed that the BDI had previously warned that trade barriers would be imposed after Brexit.Labour MP Chris Leslie, said: "The reality is the Leave campaign want to quit the single market and that would mean making almost half of Britain's trade harder and more expensive. 'And last night they admitted that doing a deal with the EU could take 'ten years'. 'That will damage our economy, cost jobs and put up prices in the shops - hurting working people. 'There is no going back from a vote to leave. If you're not 100% sure, don't risk your family's future. Vote to remain on Thursday.' Markus Kerber,the head of the BDI - the federation of German industries - said it would be 'very very foolish' to put up trade barriers 

Car giants 'will be desperate to keep trading with UK': Leave campaign hits back at warnings from companies about Brexit 2016-6-21The Leave campaign last night hit back at warnings from foreign car companies about Brexit – claiming those same firms will be ‘desperate’ to strike a trade deal with Britain if it quits the EU.American motor giant Ford claimed in a memo to its 14,000 UK staff that remaining in the EU would help create an ‘even stronger business and create a more secure future’ for employees.Bosses of Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota, BMW and Vauxhall also said Brexit would put jobs and investment at risk.Scroll down for video David Cameron speaks to workers about the benefits of Britain staying in the EU, during a visit to Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plantFord warned Britain could lose access to free trade deals, and that hefty tariffs of up to 10 per cent could be imposed on imported vehicles and 2.7 per cent on exports.Ford said: ‘This would significantly impact our business. The time taken to renegotiate trade agreements with the EU and other countries also risks leading to a prolonged period of uncertainty.’The car industry has been one of Britain’s brightest success stories since the financial crisis, supporting 800,000 jobs in the UK and contributing £15.5billion to the economy.Trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders added that the strong British car industry could be jeopardised if the public votes to leave the EU.The Remain campaign is hoping that the dire warnings from some of the biggest car manufacturers will unnerve voters ahead of the referendum.But last night Eurosceptics rejected the gloomy prognosis put forward by the industry. Professor Patrick Minford, co-chairman of Economists For Brexit, and a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, said: ‘The British car industry is hugely successful and has competed with all comers in the world.‘I don’t see why it can’t thrive outside the EU. The Germans and the French will be desperate to do a trade deal with us because the UK is such a key market.’The boss of Aston Martin told employees that leaving the EU would make British exports ‘more competitive’ because of the likely devaluation of the poundJacob Rees-Mogg, the Eurosceptic Tory MP, said car manufacturers are 'doing much better outside of the single market'And deviating from the car industry’s script the boss of Aston Martin told employees that leaving the EU would make British exports ‘more competitive’ because of the likely devaluation of the pound.In a memo to its 1,800 UK staff, the firm – which is jointly owned by Italian and Kuwaiti investment firms – weighed up the pros and cons of Brexit.The EU must take a long, hard look at itself whatever the result of the referendum, European Council president Donald Tusk said yesterday.The ex-Polish prime minister, who chairs meetings of EU leaders, said they should not ignore dissatisfaction with Brussels across the continent.Speaking during a visit to Portugal, he said: ‘Whatever the result is going to be, we must take a long, hard look on the future of the Union. We would be foolish if we ignored such a warning signal as the UK referendum.’Mr Tusk also pleaded with British voters not to leave, saying: ‘Without you, not only Europe, but the whole Western community will become weaker.’Chief executive Andy Palmer said it would probably have a ‘negative effect on UK GDP growth in the near term’.But he added the impact ‘is likely to be offset in part by the depreciation in the pound making our exports more competitive’.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Eurosceptic Tory MP, said: ‘Car manufacturers are doing much better outside of the single market. 'They are refusing to see this and are just drinking their own bathwater. It’s good to see that Aston Martin is being more phlegmatic – much like James Bond would be.’ The Leave camp argues firms such as Germany’s BMW and Volkswagen and French car maker Peugeot are so reliant on the UK market that they will rush to strike a free trade agreement with Britain.They also point out that sales outside the EU are growing faster to rapidly growing countries such as China and India than within the struggling single market. A record number of cars – 77.3 per cent of total production – were exported, with 1,227,881 vehicles leaving the UK. Demand from the EU grew 11.3 per cent, with 57.5 per cent of cars sold to the continent.But sales of British-made cars to countries outside the EU are growing more rapidly, with demand from the US rising by 26.5 per cent.

The first 100 days of freedom: How the world would change if we vote for Brexit2016-6-22A Brexit vote on June 23 could see us embarking on a path to an enlightened era of prosperous global trade, freed from the shackles of unelected Brussels bureaucracy.Or if you listen to the Remain camp, it could be the end of Western civilisation, with the continent descending into war and pensioners going hungry. Whichever side of the European argument you fall, the only certainty seems to be that things would be pretty lively. So what would the first 100 days after a vote to leave look like?David Cameron would appear outside Downing Street in the early hours of June 24 to admit defeatJune 24 A shattered David Cameron would appear outside 10 Downing Street to concede defeat.The Prime Minister will promise to implement the wishes of the British people, but his speech will be necessarily short on detail.Only semi-independent Greenland has quit the EU before, and that was 30 years ago when the island had a population of just 56,000.  The PM could well hold off on a dramatic announcement about his own future in the immediate aftermath of a Brexit vote - although it is almost impossible that his premiership will be able to survive the defeat for long. He could fire the starting gun on a Tory leadership contest, which Brexit champion Boris Johnson would almost certainly win.  The Treasury, Bank of England and European Central Bank would activate contingency plans to shore up the currency and inject liquidity to banks to ensure the system keeps working.June 28-29EU leaders are due to gather for a summit in Brussels, at which there will be only one topic - the Brexit vote.They could even bring the meeting forward by a few days if their anxiety is great enough. Mr Cameron could formally notify them of our intention to leave, trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the legal process for quitting the 28 nation bloc.That starts the clock on a two-year period during which we negotiate a new set of arrangements in areas such as trade, justice and reciprocal visas. However, the PM may hold off as some Leave campaigners do not want to invoke Article 50 at all, believing it puts our negotiators at a disadvantage.Instead we could try to force the EU to strike a deal without imposing a time limit - but that may depend on whether other states are willing to play ball.David Cameron (left) will tell European Council President Donald Tusk (right) and EU leaders of Britain's desire to leave if he loses the vote on June 23July 6 As the immediate shock of the Brexit vote eases, the government machine gears up to the task of negotiating a new deal with the EU and replacing other bilateral trade agreements.Despite volatility on the markets, the public will almost certainly be surprised to find that little changes in their everyday lives.Importantly, there is virtually no chance that George Osborne's threat of a post-Brexit 'punishment' Budget will happen. That is partly because victorious Conservative Eurosceptics will have demanded Mr Osborne is moved from No11, but also because the hit to the real economy will not have been as immediate as some made out.On July 6, Mr Cameron will be able to lead the government response to the publication of the long-awaited Iraq Inquiry report. Shortly afterwards he is due to attend a Nato summit.David Cameron would probably stay on in Number 10 until a swiftly-held Conservative leadership contest can be held - most likely to be won by leading Brexit campaigners like Boris Johnson (right) or Michael Gove (left)July 21Parliament is due to rise for its summer break, but there will be little rest for ministers as they are consumed by the negotiations. The civil service has been quietly contingency planning for the possibility of our departure, with every department set to be affected by the seismic changes. But Mr Cameron, if he is still in place, will be largely peripheral to the process.  Having been so closely associated with the Remain campaign, it is almost inconceivable that Mr Cameron would be regarded as a credible head negotiator.It is possible that another, Brexit-supporting minister such as Michael Gove could be appointed to oversee the work. Vote Leave said the government should invite figures from other parties, business, the law and civil society to join the negotiating team to 'get a good deal in the national interest'. By now the Tory leadership contest is likely to be in full swing.The party's rules mean MPs nominate two candidates, who are then put forward for an election by the wider membership.  Boris Johnson would be in prime position to take over from Mr Cameron after a Brexit vote Mid-August If the Conservative leadership takes a similar length of time as in 2005, this is around when the successor to Mr Cameron could be announced.Given the need for someone to take charge of the talks, it is likely there would be a strong desire to move as fast as possible.Mr Johnson would be in a position to win a very strong mandate, as the politician who did the most to deliver the Brexit vote.SeptemberParliament is due back, and while the early autumn sitting it usually viewed as a sop to those who complain MPs do not work hard enough, this year it could be extremely busy.Vote Leave has called for legislation in the current session of Parliament to 'end the European Court of Justice's control over national security and allow the government to deport criminals from the EU'.The Brexiteers have also pledged abolish the 5 per cent rate of VAT on household energy bills by amending the Value Added Tax Act 1994.Other parliamentary actions promised by the Leave campaign include ending the automatic right of all EU citizens to enter the UK, and - finally - repealing the European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill.That is the legislation that guarantees the supremacy of EU law to domestic rules.However, it is not clear how fast the Brexiteers will be able to cut the ties to Brussels.Around three quarters of MPs support EU membership, and some are already considering how that weight of numbers can be used to limit the impact of a Leave vote.  There could be efforts to defy the public will altogether, or keep us in the single market rather than quitting the bloc altogether.Iain Duncan Smith has said that MPs who ignore the outcome of the referendum it would trigger a 'constitutional crisis' and potentially a snap general election. October 5 The political party conference season is always frantic, but this year it will have an even greater significance. The realignment of politics set in train by the referendum would have been huge for Britain and for Europe.Just after the first hundred days draws to a close, the new Tory Prime Minister could take to the stage in Birmingham to address activists.Mr Johnson - if he has emerged victorious - would be able to argue that the UK has made a start in its new life independent from Brussels.Britain would become the first fully-signed up member of the European Union to quit if voters back Brexit in the June 23 referendum. Only Greenland has left the union and that was more than 30 years ago, when the union was called the European Community  

You're LYING! IDS accused Cameron of 'colluding' with the EU over Turkey's membership in an extraordinary attack on the eve of the referendum2016-6-22David Cameron has 'colluded' with the EU and is 'lying' to British voters over the EU, Iain Duncan Smith blasted today. The former work and pensions secretary reacted with fury to the confirmation from the Turkish government it saw Mr Cameron as the 'chief supporter' of its EU bid.Vote Leave also claimed ex-PM Sir John Major had admitted today Turkish membership was possible within the lifetime of children at school today despite Mr Cameron's claims it will not happen before the year 3000.Turkey's possible membership of the EU has dominated much of the referendum campaign as Vote Leave warned the country's accession would mean even higher levels of net migration. Iain Duncan Smith today accused David Cameron of 'colluding' with the EU over Turkey and claimed he was 'lying' to the British people Mr Duncan Smith said: 'David Cameron has repeatedly claimed that Turkey is not going to join the EU despite it being Government policy. Now the Turkish government has confirmed that he is the 'chief supporter' of their bid to join the EU.'Cameron also said that Turkey will not join until the year 3000 but Sir John Major has let the cat out of the bag - Turkey could be in the EU in ten years' time.'I'm afraid there is no conclusion you can draw from this, except that David Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people.'Families are suffering the consequences of uncontrolled migration - a direct result of the EU's obsession with freedom of movement.'They are suffering from downward pressure on their wages, and facing increased competition for housing, school places, and GP appointments to name but a few.'With five more countries lining up to join the EU - Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Turkey - this problem can only get worse.'That's why it is safer to Vote Leave.'Sir John Major, pictured today at an eve-of-poll rally, said Turkey would not join within decades but Vote Leave said this implied a much sooner timetable than admitted to by David Cameron At a Britain Stronger in Europe rally in Bristol today, Sir John said: 'I find it extraordinary that people should point to Turkey, and suggest that 77 million Turks are suddenly going to descend and take all of our hospital places and all our school places and all our local authority dwellings. The issue of Turkish accession to the EU has become caught up in the campaign for Thursday's bitterly-fought Brexit referendum.Amid charges by the 'Leave' camp that accession will allow millions of Turks into the country, the issue has exploded the debate over immigration.David Cameron insists Turkey will not join the 28-nation bloc for years, even though the government's official position is to support Ankara's membership.Since Muslim-majority Turkey formally launched its membership bid in 2005, the EU has opened 15 chapters out of the 35 required to join the bloc.So far only one chapter has been completed, with disagreements over Turkey's human rights record an obstacle for many EU states.Under the March accord, the EU also agreed to boost aid to Turkey to cope with millions of refugees, mostly Syrians, on its territory and to speed up visa liberalisation.'They have been negotiating for 30 years without getting in. They are not going to get in in my judgment for one, two decades - perhaps not ever.'Even if they do get in, we're not in the Schengen zone. Even if it happened in some far distant future, what obscenity it is to suggest all 77 million Turks are suddenly going to say, let's go to the United Kingdom.'The national minimum wage has risen by 50p, let's get there as fast as we can! If they do happen to say that, let me just mention to them in advance that they would actually earn more in France or in Germany than they actually would here.'Vote Leave said this meant Sir John was accepting the possibility by talking about the possibility of Turkey joining in 'one, two decades'. The EU will in open new membership talks with Turkey as planned in a few days, EU diplomatic sources said Wednesday, just as Ankara's accession becomes a hot-button issue in Britain's vote on its future in the bloc.One source, who asked not to be named, told AFP that EU member states will meet June 30 to agree to open a new negotiating chapter with Turkey on finance and budget affairs.European Union leaders pledged in March to speed up Turkey's long-stalled membership talks as part of an accord on tackling the migration crisis, promising to open at least one new chapter by the end of June. British voters were today warned there is no chance of a second renegotiation with the EU if they back Brexit tomorrow.Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU Commission President, said 'out is out' and ruled out re-opening talks in a bid to reverse a vote to quit the EU.In remarks sure to be seized upon by the Vote Leave campaign, Mr Juncker said David Cameron got the 'maximum' reform possible in his renegotiation that was concluded in February.The deal has been derided as empty and useless by Brexit campaigners and the Prime Minister has been forced to admit more reform is still needed.EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker today claimed David Cameron had already extracted the 'maximum' from the EU Britain would not get any other reforms by voting for Brexit Mr Juncker said today: 'The British policy makers and British voters have to know that there will not be any kind of renegotiation.'Out is out.'He added: 'We have concluded a deal with the prime minister. He got the maximum he could receive and we gave the maximum we could give.'So there will be no renegotiation, not on the agreement we found in February, nor as far as any kind of treaty negotiations are concerned.'Vote Leave champion Michael Gove said: 'The Remain Campaign has been claiming in recent days that if you vote to stay in the EU then there could be further reform. The President of the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, has made very clear today that will not happen.'If you vote to stay there is no prospect of getting any reform from the EU ever again. We will never get back control of the £350 million we give to the EU every week. The Prime Minister tried to get reforms earlier this year but the EU did not listen. The EU cannot and will not give the British people the change that they want.'There is a very clear choice in this referendum. Either you vote to keep on giving the EU more power and more of our money every year or join me in voting leave to take back control.'Michael Gove has made a grovelling apology after comparing pro-EU experts to Nazi propagandists.The Justice Secretary admitted he had been 'clumsy and inappropriate' to make the comments as he dismissed dire forecasts for the consequences of Brexit.The climbdown came after David Cameron branded the remarks a 'massive mistake' and suggested that Mr Gove had 'lost it'.Michael Gove (pictured) compared economic experts warning about the fall-out of Brexit to the Nazis who orchestrated a smear campaign against Albert Einstein in the 1930sRecalling the Nazis' treatment of Jewish scientist Einstein during the 1930s, Mr Gove had told LBC: 'I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and to ask if these arguments are good.'We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his theories were denounced, and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was because he was Jewish.'They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said: 'Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.'''Mr Gove added: 'The truth is that if you look at the quality of the analysis, if you look at the facts on the ground, you can come to an appropriate conclusion.'And the appropriate conclusion, I think, all of us can come to is that with growth rates so low in Europe, with so many unemployed and with the nature of the single currency so damaging, freeing ourselves from that project can only strengthen our economy.'He made his comments after being challenged over why he is not heeding the advice of many economists who have warned that Brexit could have dire consequences and tip the economy into recession.David Cameron has blamed mass immigration on our 'unnatural' economy as he insisted numbers will be curbed if we stay in the EU.As the referendum campaign enters its final frantic hours, the Prime Minister said freedom of movement rules will be re-examined if we stay in the bloc.He defended his target of bringing net migration down from around 330,000 a year to below 100,000 as 'realistic', and also denied that being in the Brussels club was like being 'shackled to a corpse'.The claims came as both sides in the bitter campaign stepped up their efforts on the eve of the crucial ballot. Mr Cameron, former PM Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet Harman staged a rally in Bristol this morning.David Cameron, former PM Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet Harman appeared together in Bristol to urge a Remain vote in the referendum tomorrowMeanwhile, Boris Johnson is crossing the country in a helicopter appealing for people to vote for Brexit.In a bad-tempered interview in BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said immigration had been stubbornly running at around three times his target over recent years because it was 'not a normal period'.'As recently as 2008, if you look at the situation of British people and European nationals leaving Britain to go to Europe and European nationals coming to Britain, there was actually net negative migration in terms of Europe,' he said. 

Get out now! Furious EU leader demands Britain makes quick exit from the EU as Prime Minister David Cameron resigns and global markets plummet over historic referendum vote to leave Europe2016-6-24Furious European Parliament President Martin Schulz has demanded the UK makes a quick exit from the EU following the shock result of Thursday's referendum. Schulz said the UK's relationship with the EU had been ambiguous, but was 'now clear' and a prolonged exit was 'the opposite of what we need'. He added that it was difficult to accept that 'a whole continent is taken hostage because of an internal fight in the Tory party'.And the presidents of the EU's main institutions said in a statement today that they expect London to act on the decision to leave 'as soon as possible, however painful that process may be'.EU Council President Donald Tusk, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Schulz and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said 'any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty'.Prime Minister David Cameron, who on Friday announced he will resign, had suggested that formal notification of Britain's departure might not come before October.Scroll down for video Resignation: David Cameron, watched by his wife Samantha, announces outside 10 Downing Street that he will be resigning as prime minister.

A survey by the Pew Research Center suggested that Greece and France are close behind Britain on opposition to the EUCameron has suggested he would delay invoking Article 50 - which triggers formal exit from the EU - until his successor takes over in the fall. Britain has up to two years to negotiate an exit, but EU officials have been insisting on quick and potentially tough negotiations to discourage the 27 other countries in the bloc from wanting to leave. Eurosceptic parties across the continent are intensifying demands for their own referendums in the wake of the Brexit vote. Shortly after the result was announced, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National in France, called for a 'Frexit' vote on Twitter, while the far-Right Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders called for a 'Nexit'. In Italy, the leader of the Italian anti-immigrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, called the European Union 'a cage of crazies' that is killing jobs and citizen dignity. And there are also fears that Brexit could also trigger a Czexit, a Swexit, and a Grexit in the Czech Republic, Sweden and Greece. Even if the union holds, the political earthquake that has erupted in Britain will have far-reaching aftershocks.World markets were thrown into turmoil on Friday after the final vote was announced, prompting Cameron to try and reassure businesses across the globe that Britain's economy was fundamentally sound.Cameron said he would stay on for three months and New York-born Boris Johnson, the former Mayor of London who led the 'leave' campaign, is the hot favorite to replace him.  President Barack Obama said the UK and EU will remain 'indispensable partners' of the United States following the Brexit vote.Obama said: 'The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom's membership in Nato remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security and economic policy.'So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond.'The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.' David and Samantha Cameron comforted each other after he made his emotional statement outside the famous door of 10 Downing StreetPresumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump arrived at the Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire, Scotland, with his family to officially open the revamped resort he bought in 2014.He said the British people had 'taken back their country', adding: 'It's a fantastic thing.'Later, when asked his opinion on Cameron quitting, Trump said: 'Well, that's too bad.'  Trump posted a statement on Facebook promising close ties between the U.S. and UK if he becomes President, saying: 'A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense.'Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said in a statement: 'We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.'We also have to make clear America's steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe. 'This time of uncertainty only underscored the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.'Her campaign has called Donald Trump's reaction to Britain's vote to leave 'dangerous and frightening'.Trump, say her aides, reacted with 'pathological self-congratulations', a lack of understanding about the situation and a focus on his own businesses rather than the economic impact on American families.Trump 'actively rooted' for the United Kingdom to leave the EU and is 'rooting for the economic turmoil in its wake', Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. Meanwhile, Trump dramatically said President Obama and Clinton pushed Britain into leaving the European Union - and predicted Americans will make a similar choice in November. He said the president - who in April lectured Britain that it must stay in and threatened it with dire economic consequences if it left - and his would-be Democratic successor had misread the mood of the free world. 'She's always misread everything, if you think. She's misread this,' Trump told DailyMail.com of Clinton, during a press conference coinciding with the re-opening of a golf course in the west of Scotland. Both Obama and Clinton urged Britons to vote with the 'Remain' forces.Boris Johnson stopped short of confirming that he would stand to succeed David Cameron today - but made a broad appeal to people to stay calm and help forge a better futureBoris Johnson (right) leaves his home in London this morning under the gaze of press photographers and protected by a considerable police presence.

But the final count saw a narrow victory for 'leave' as the nation split 52-48 in favor of becoming the first of the 28 EU member states to request an exit.Stocks plunged in the U.S. and worldwide Friday. The result of the vote stunned investors, who reacted by rushing to the safety of gold and U.S. government bonds as they wondered what will come next for Britain, Europe and the global economy.U.S. stocks gave up all their gains from earlier in the year.

Meet Boris Johnson, the American-born eccentric who is favorite to become Britain's next Prime Minister.David Cameron announced his plans to resign as Prime Minister this morning after the UK voted to leave the European Union in an historic referendum.Johnson -  known as BoJo, or just Boris, by the British public - is now odds-on to succeed Cameron after spearheading the Brexit campaign. Sky high: Boris Johnson (pictured stuck on a zip wire at the 2012 Olympics in London) is favorite to become the UK's next Prime MinisterJohnson (seen yawning during the 2015 General Election) - known as BoJo, or just Boris, by the British public - is now odds-on to succeed Cameron after spearheading the Brexit campaignThe Conservative Member of Parliament and former Mayor of London was born on Manhattan's Upper East Side.He remained a joint U.S. citizen until last year, when he announced he was giving it up to show his commitment to Britain.Johnson's family moved back to the UK just months after he was born and he grew up in Oxfordshire.He went on to study at the prestigious Eton College, where David Cameron also studied, before the pair met as part of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford University.The exclusive all-male dining society is known for its members drunkenly trashing restaurants before handing over money to pay for the damage.Johnson studied classics at Oxford, where he became known as a joker because of his buffoon-like character.Using bizarre, antiquated language, Johnson was known for babbling on - and has continued to use this technique to deflect tough questions as a politician.He joined The Times newspaper in London after he graduated, but was sacked in disgrace just months later after he was caught out making up a quote.Johnson is known for his gaffes and flattened a Japanese child during a game of rugby in Tokyo last yearJohnson, circled, attended Oxford University and was part of the elite dining society the Bullingdon Club, alongside David Cameron (second from top left)Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

However, he reignited his political ambitions and became an MP in the next election, in 2001.Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

He married his first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987 but split with her six years later.Their rocky marriage came to an end after Johnson revealed he was sleeping with Marina Wheeler, who was already pregnant with his child by the time his wife found out.Johnson married Wheeler the same year he finalized his divorce with Ms Mostyn-Owen, but that did not halt his philandering.He denied the long-running affair with Ms Wyatt as an 'inverted pyramid of piffle', until it was proven and he was sacked.Wheeler kicked him out of the family home but later took him back - and did the same thing again after Johnson fathered a child with another woman.The existence of the child only became public knowledge in 2013 after an injunction was quashed. A judge ruled the public had the right to know about his 'reckless' behavior.Johnson is now favorite to be Britain's next Prime Minister after leading the Brexit campaign to victoryDespite Johnson's scandalous personal life, the public's opinion would not be changed and in 2008 he was elected London Mayor. During his time as Mayor, his blond mop of hair was often seen whizzing through the British capital on one of the city's pay-to-use bicycles, which became known as 'Boris Bikes'.He held onto the job until earlier this year, when he resigned to concentrate on being an MP and his not-so-secret ambition to become Prime Minister.Johnson's seemingly untouchable public image is believed to be linked to his down-to-earth nature and his ability to entertain.During the London Olympics in 2012, he got stuck on a zip-line and was left suspended in the air. The gaffe was something most politicians would never live down, but Johnson laughed it off.He also flattened a Japanese child during a game of rugby last year and tripped over a boy while playing soccer.His way with words has also enchanted the public, including on one occasion where he called local politicians in London 'great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies' after they failed to quiz him on his policies.Johnson has also claimed voting for his party 'will cause your wife to have bigger breasts and increase your chances of owning a BMW'. The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples.They have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense.The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration.Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence.Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first.They will have the chance to reject today’s rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.I hope America is watching, it will soon be time to believe in America again. As the polls closed Thursday, UKIP leader Farage set a downbeat tone for the supporters of a British exit — or Brexit — from the EU, telling Sky News television 'it looks like 'remain' will edge it' in the referendum, sending the pound to a 2016 peak of $1.50.But he withdrew those comments later, telling reporters at a 'leave' party in central London 'maybe just under half, maybe just over half of the country' had voted to pull Britain out of the EU.Pollster Ipsos MORI said a survey conducted on Wednesday and Thursday suggested the 'remain' side would win Britain's EU referendum by a margin of 54 per cent to 46 per cent.But on Thursday the firm had released a poll that indicated a 52-48 victory for 'remain'.That phone poll of 1,592 people had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. And it proved to be wrong by exactly that margin.The overseas territory of Gibraltar, off the coast of southern Spain, was the first to report results late Thursday, and as expected the British enclave reported an overwhelming vote for 'remain' — 96 per cent.There as elsewhere, turnout appeared high. Officials in the Rock of Gibraltar said almost 84 per cent of eligible voters turned out to cast ballots; witnesses and reporters elsewhere said turnout was higher than in last year's general election, which was 66 per cent.On Friday, Spain seized on the result to call for co-sovereignty of Gibraltar. Spain's acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said: 'It's a complete change of outlook that opens up new possibilities on Gibraltar not seen for a very long time. 'I hope the formula of co-sovereignty - to be clear, the Spanish flag on the Rock - is much closer than before.'High turnout had been expected to boost the 'remain' vote, because 'leave' supporters are thought to be more motivated. But high turnout in working-class areas that typically have lower tallies also boosted the 'leave' vote.That was certainly the case in Newcastle, a city which had been expected to deliver a resounding victory for 'remain', Instead, the pro-Europe side squeaked by with 50.7 per cent of the vote. In Sunderland, 61 per cent of voters chose 'leave,' a bigger-than expected margin.Referendum workers verify the validity of ballots in Britain's overseas of territory of Gibraltar, where 96 per cent of voters opted for the UK to remain in the EU. Spain seized on the Brexit vote to call for co-sovereignty with Britain in Gibraltar This pro-EU campaigner in Northern Ireland checks his mobile phone for early results, which painted a grim picture for the overall result. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister later called for a referendum on Ulster joining the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EUPolls had for months suggested a close battle, although the past few days have seen some indication of momentum swinging toward the 'remain' side.  At a referendum night party at the London School of Economics, Kevin Featherstone, the head of the European Institute, said the vote should serve as a wake-up call to politicians across the continent.'Wider Europe has got to learn the lesson about how to re-engage with ordinary publics,' he said. 'We can see across Europe countries which have been... far bigger supporters of the European Union for a number of years starting to have serious doubts.'But Peter Lundgren, an MEP from the far-right Sweden Democrat Party, told MailOnline: 'This is the beginning of the end for the EU. So many other countries will follow the UK. Europe will fall.' David Cameron delivering his resignation statement this morningThe country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise – perhaps the biggest in our history. Over 33 million people – from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar – have all had their say.We should be proud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people with these big decisions.We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we are governed, there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves - and that is what we have done.The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument, including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believed was the national interest.And let me congratulate all those who took part in the leave campaign – for the spirited and passionate case that they made.The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision.So there can be no doubt about the result.Across the world people have been watching the choice that Britain has made. I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain's economy is fundamentally strong.And I would also reassure Brits living in European countries and European citizens living here that there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances. There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union. This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Governments, to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced.But above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership.I am very proud and very honoured to have been Prime Minister of this country for six years.I believe we have made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history; with reforms to welfare and education; increasing people's life chances; building a bigger and stronger society; keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world, and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality.But above all restoring Britain's economic strength, and I am grateful to everyone who has helped to make that happen.I have also always believed that we have to confront big decisions – not duck them.That's why we delivered the first Coalition government in seventy years to bring our economy back from the brink. It's why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland. And why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain's position in the European Union and hold a referendum on our membership, and have carried those things out.I fought this campaign in the only way I know how – which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel – head, heart and soul.I held nothing back.I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union, and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone – not the future of any single politician, including myself.But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.This is not a decision I have taken lightly, but I do believe it is in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required.There is no need for a precise timetable today, but in my view we should aim to have a new Prime Minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October.Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen's Speech.

That not only needs to be respected – but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.Britain is a special country.We have so many great advantages.A parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate; a great trading nation, with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity respected the world over.And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multi-racial, multi-faith democracy, where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows.Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I have said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union and indeed that we could find a way.Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way, and I will do everything I can to help.I love this country – and I feel honoured to have served it.And I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed.Conservative leadership contests are fought in two parts - first the Tory MPs whittle down the contenders to just two before the Tory membership picks a winner.The format has a habit of squeezing out contenders and in 2005 Liam Fox ran but never made it into the final round - contested in the end by David Cameron and David Davis.  BORIS JOHNSONThe overwhelming favorite going into the contest, the former Mayor of London has led the Vote Leave campaign to an improbable victory. Declaring for Brexit in February cemented the Uxbridge MP as a darling of the Tory right and he seems certain to make the shortlist.Johnson has a celebrity unique among British politicians but despite eight years running the capital, he will have a big job to do to persuade the country he is up to leading the country. GEORGE OSBORNE The Chancellor of the Exchequer has long been the heir-apparent to David Cameron.The Prime Minister's deputy and close ally has spent six years in Number 11, is credited by many in the Tory Party for rescuing the economy and is a prized tactician.But his leadership bid has almost certainly been crashed off the tracks by a catastrophic Budget in March and his role standing shoulder to shoulder with the PM during the referendum campaign. RUTH DAVIDSON The Leader of the Scottish Conservatives arrives at the contest having pulled off the near miracle of overhauling Labour to take second in Scotland.Davidson was a star of the referendum campaign for her combative appearance at the final TV debate and as someone a million miles from the old Etonian Tory which has proven toxic with much of the electorate she would be prized by the One Nation wing of the party. Her candidacy is a longshot - not least because she is not an MP and has a huge job opposing Nicola Sturgeon in Holyrood. But on the day Britain backed Brexit is anything impossible? THERESA MAYAfter six years as Home Secretary, Theresa May is the sober, serious choice - and probably the strongest 'continuity candidate' who could succeed Cameron.May has become the longest serving Home Secretary, thriving in a brief which has proved the graveyard for many a political career. Tough, a safe pair of hands and widely respected - if not always seen fondly - May could be the anti-Boris.STEPHEN CRABBPerhaps the biggest unknown in the race, the work and pensions secretary was parachuted into the top of front line politics as the replacement for Iain Duncan Smith after his bombshell resignation over the Budget.Crabb, a Welsh son of a broken home, could be the leading One Nation candidate in the leadership race.Being a new name - and one who was quiet in the referendum - could allow Crabb to define himself a unifying candidate. LIAM FOX A heavy weight with Cabinet experience, Fox has run for the leadership before - and lost.But he is extremely popular on the right of the party and played a leading role in referendum campaign, appearing with different parts of the Leave movement.The former defence secretary is known to have a war chest ready and waiting for the leadership campaign and is well connected on the Tory benches.While it is perhaps hard to see a route onto the final shortlist, Fox would undoubtedly be well organised and a fearsome candidate.  Banking giants consider moving thousands of jobs out of Britain after Brexit vote as big businesses warn of a profits slum City rocked: Banking giant JP Morgan is reportedly considering moving staff from his London HQ to Paris after today's Brexit voteSeveral of the world's biggest banks are already considering sending thousands of jobs out of Britain after today's Brexit win.JP Morgan, the globe's biggest investment bank, and BNP Paribas, France's financial giant, are reportedly looking at whether they should now move their London bases to Paris.But American giant Morgan Stanley has denied rumours that it is planning to move 2,000 investment banking jobs to Frankfurt and Dublin.It came as British Airways owner IAG issued a profit warning following the UK's decision to leave the EU.The company's share price tanked 19 per cent to 425.6p in trading on Friday morning.City workers are braced for months of pain as banks and financial institutions begin the process of considering whether to slash jobs or relocate to Europe in the wake of Brexit.HSBC and Goldman Sachs all said prior to the vote that thousands of jobs in the City of London could be moved to the continent in the event of Brexit.Sarah Phillips, partner at solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said the Brexit vote will have a 'big impact' on people working in Britain's financial services sector.She added: 'Many banks, insurers and fund managers who have large businesses in continental Europe could consider relocating to Paris or Frankfurt and senior staff will either lose their roles or have to move to another country.'Some global investment banks, such as JPMorgan, have said that Brexit would lead to a significant loss of jobs in the UK.'HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver said in February that a vote to leave could see 5,000 London-based investment bankers move out of London to Paris.Jamie Dimon, head of JP Morgan, said earlier this month that up to 4,000 jobs could be hit.Although banks have been cautious on Friday in making any brash statements regarding their future plans, experts are forecasting that large scale redundancies could be on the cards.Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde & Co, said: 'At a more fundamental level, unless the financial services passporting rules are resolved in the UK's favour, then many large financial services businesses are likely to relocate to within the EU - meaning large scale redundancies would be highly probable.'Many banks and businesses joined the Remain campaign and warned of catastrophe have today looked to reassure instead.Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein has said the bank respects the decision of the British electorate, while HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said that 'we are today entering a new era for Britain and British business'. Virgin founder Richard Branson said today it 'a very sad decision that will do huge damage to Britain's prosperity and Europe's stability'.Oil and gas experts Royal Dutch Shell said: 'Although Shell was in favor of the UK remaining in the EU, we respect the decision of the majority of the British people who voted to elect to leave.'We will work with the UK government and European institutions on any implications for us. Our priority is to continue providing reliable, affordable energy to our customers in Europe and the UK.' Unsurprisingly, news that Britain has voted to leave the European Union has made the front pages of every major US newspaper.The New York Times asked whether the European Union and the UK would now be able hold together.The paper’s London-based reporter Steven Erlanger wrote: ‘Will Britain retreat to become a Little England, nationalist and a touch xenophobic, responding to the voters that drove it to quit the European Union?The New York Times front page reports that the 'Brexit outcome rattles fiscal markets' (left). The New York Times website (right) asked whether the European Union and the UK would now be able hold togetherThe Boston Globe (left) focused on the effect the decision has on the markets. The Wall Street Journal front page reports that the pound nose-dives and stocks plunge‘Even more important: Will it even hold together? With Scotland deeply pro-European, pressure will increase for another independence referendum that could bring an end to the United Kingdom.’He added: ‘Britain, a nation whose storied history has encompassed the birth of constitutional government, global empire, royal pageantry and heroic defense against fascism, is entering unknown territory. The questions about its new path could remain unresolved for years.’The New York Daily News bluntly reported that ‘the Brits told the European Union to bugger off’, adding that the ‘hard-fought referendum’ was ‘seething with wide-reaching economic and political effects’.The Los Angeles Times stated that ‘Britain is once again an island’, with the ‘historic vote’ something that ‘could profoundly reshape Europe’s economy’.The heavyweight Washington Post explained that ‘British voters have defied the will of their leaders, foreign allies and much of the political establishment by opting to rupture the country’s primary connection to Europe in a stunning result that will radiate economic and political uncertainty across the globe'.The Boston Herald (left) declares that the vote in the UK 'stuns the world' and uses the headline 'Brits quit'. The heavyweight Washington Post explained that ‘British voters have defied the will of their leaders, foreign allies and much of the political establishment'The homepage of The Seattle Times reported how the British pound has taken a huge tumbleThe Chicago Tribune described the referendum campaign as ‘bitterly divisive’ and stated that British politics was now in ‘disarray’.It said: ‘Britain voted to leave the European Union after a bitterly divisive referendum campaign, sending global markets plunging Friday, casting British politics into disarray and shattering the stability of a project in continental unity designed half a century ago to prevent World War III.’The New York Post struggled to marshal the facts, wrongly stating that it was England, and not the UK, that had left the EU.It said: 'The seismic moves underscore how unprepared Wall Street and financial centers around the world were for England to leave the EU.'  USA Today called the result a 'stunning rebuke'.It said: 'In a stunning rebuke to the “European project” and their own political class, British voters defied opinion polls and market expectations and chose to leave theby a decisive margin.'The result – the first time any member of the 28-nation EU has chosen to leave the union – will have repercussions for both Britain and the EU, and perhaps for the global economy, that are difficult to forecast.' The Los Angeles Times (left) stated that ‘Britain is once again an island’, with the ‘historic vote’ something that ‘could profoundly reshape Europe’s economy’. The Chicago Tribune (right) described the referendum campaign ‘bitterly divisive’ and stated that British politics was now in ‘disarray’Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

Nailed, the four big EU lies: Talks with Turkey will start in days, Brexit WON'T spark trade war say Germans, Brussels will NOT reform on open borders and deportation of jobless EU migrants a myth2016-6-22Four key claims made by the Remain camp were demolished last night in the final hours of the referendum battle.As voters prepared to go to the polls in a knife-edge contest, Leave supporters said David Cameron's arguments on Turkey, trade, migration and welfare had fallen apart.And in a final impassioned plea, Michael Gove declared today was 'D-Day' for current generations of Britons. He urged wavering voters not to flinch from regaining sovereignty from a Brussels machine that would leave their country poorer and less secure.As voters prepared to go to the polls in a knife-edge contest, Leave supporters said David Cameron's arguments on Turkey, trade, migration and welfare had fallen apart. Pictured, the Prime Minister yesterdayPolls make the contest neck and neck. 'It's 50:50,' said Professor John Curtice – the only analyst to have predicted last year's election result.Making his final arguments for Britain to remain in the EU, the Prime Minister suffered a series of body blows from events and interventions beyond his control:Turkey's bid to join the EU has been a central issue in the campaign, amid concerns of an influx from a country with rock bottom wages.Mr Cameron has backtracked on his pledge to be the 'strongest possible advocate' for Turkish membership of the EU, and insisted it will not happen 'until the year 3000'. But he has repeatedly refused to say he would veto Turkish accession.And yesterday it emerged the EU will resume talks on Turkish membership next week, just days after the referendum.Michael Gove declared today was 'D-Day' for current generations of BritonsJohn Major, who was campaigning alongside Mr Cameron yesterday, also appeared to suggest Turkey could join the EU far more quickly, saying: 'They are not going to get in in my judgment for one, two decades – perhaps not ever.'Iain Duncan Smith, a Leave campaigner and another former Tory leader, said Sir John had let the cat out of the bag.And he accused Mr Cameron of deliberate deception, saying: 'I'm afraid there is no conclusion you can draw from this, except that David Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people.'Writing in the Daily Mail today, he adds: 'As much as the PM suggests otherwise, the issue of Turkey and the future of its 77million population ought to be in voters' minds today as they enter the polling booth.'The Prime Minister used a final round of media interviews yesterday to claim reform to the EU's free movement rules would continue 'on Friday' if Britain votes Remain today. But within hours he had been undermined by Mr Juncker.The president of the European Commission said Britain had already received 'the maximum' on offer.Mr Cameron's claim that Brexit would spark a trade war that would wreck the economy was also undermined when the head of Germany's leading business organisation, the BDI, vowed to fight any attempt to impose tariffs.Markus Kerber said it would be 'very, very foolish' for EU countries to try to use trade barriers to punish Britain for leaving – not least because Europe sells more to us than we do to them.The Prime Minister also repeated his discredited claim that his reforms meant that the UK was now able to deport EU jobseekers if they failed to find work within six months.Mr Cameron made the claim twice yesterday.Jonathan Portes, an economist, accused the PM of 'repeating a known falsehood' – and said no one had been kicked out of Britain as a result of reforms.In his final pitch to voters at a rally in Birmingham, the Prime Minister said: 'What this vote is all about, it's about our economy, it's about jobs, it's about livelihoods and futures, but it's also about the sort of country we want to be.Boris Johnson gives a thumbs up as he leaves Selby, North Yorkshire, on the final day of campaigning'I am passionate about this country, I am wildly patriotic about what we've done in the past and what we can do in the future. The sort of Great Britain I want, an even greater country doesn't walk away, it doesn't quit, it stays and it fights.'Speculation was already swirling at Westminster about how MPs will react when the polls finally close at 10pm tonight.A letter – signed by Mr Gove and Boris Johnson, along with scores of other Tory MPs – is expected to be released at 10pm calling for Mr Cameron to remain in office regardless of the result.An exclusive survey for the Daily Mail and ITV News, gave the Remain camp a lead of six points, by 48 per cent to 42 per cent – 11 per cent of voters are still undecided.Crucially, the Leave campaign's key message that now is the time for Britain to take control of its own destiny has had the biggest impact on the country's voters.Some 44 per cent said it made them more likely to vote to quit the Brussels club – outstripping the claim by the Remain camp that leaving is a leap in the dark.Downing Street stood by its claim that Turkey was not on course to join the EU. It said yesterday's announcement related to the opening of only one of more than 30 areas of negotiation that Turkey must conclude.No 10 sources also argued Mr Juncker's comments were being misrepresented. They said he had been ruling out further negotiations in the event of Brexit – not if the UK votes to Remain.LIE ONE: Giving jobless migrants the boot 'is a myth'Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, said Mr Cameron knew his claim about kicking out jobless migrants was 'not true'By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail David Cameron was last night accused of ‘treating voters with contempt’ after he repeated ‘false’ claims about kicking out jobless migrants.Twice yesterday the Prime Minister said EU migrants have to leave the country if they don’t have a job after six months.Mr Cameron has used the claim repeatedly during the referendum campaign despite it being rubbished both by the Leave camp and independent economists.Last night, Jonathan Portes, an economist and former civil servant, said the PM was guilty of ‘repeating a known falsehood’.He wrote on Twitter: ‘What can you say? Deliberately repeating a known falsehood. Treating voters with contempt. Let’s be clear. Vote to Remain is vote for free movement. Principle is not up for discussion.’Mr Portes has said the number of people kicked out under the six-month rule has been ‘zero’.And former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the Mail: ‘The claim is not true, and he knows it. The truth is there is no mechanism, and no legal right to send people home if they do not have a job.‘The European Union’s core principle of freedom of movement dictates that people are free not only to travel here, but to remain. And for as long as we remain in the EU we are powerless to do anything about it.‘The only way to take back control of our borders, and introduce a fair immigration system, is to vote leave today.’When he was in office, civil servants told Mr Duncan Smith the chances of removing an EU citizen from Britain if they do not get a job after six months was ‘close to zero’.He said Whitehall officials told him migrants can easily get around the regulations, and that the Home Office admitted it did not have the staff or the capacity to enforce it.Mr Cameron used the claim yesterday on Radio 4. Today presenter John Humphrys put to him that on benefits, his EU renegotiation ‘doesn’t add up to a row of beans’.The PM replied: ‘Well it does. What it means is that if people come here they can’t claim unemployment benefit, if they don’t have a job after six months they have to leave and if they do work they have to work for four years before they get full access to our welfare system.’Again, later in the day, Mr Cameron told LBC radio: ‘If you vote Remain then we get the changes that I have negotiated and that means that if somebody comes to Britain from the European Union, they can’t claim unemployment benefit.‘If they haven’t got a job after six months they have to leave.’Mr Cameron claimed credit for the rule change, saying it was secured as part of his renegotiation ‘deal’.But last night the Home Office said the six-months rule was introduced on January 1, 2014.Mr Duncan Smith was in charge of implementing the rule change as Work and Pensions Secretary.But he said the Home Office told him they were unable to force anyone to leave as a result of not having secured a job.Vote Leave argue that as well as there being no mechanism for monitoring whether or not jobseekers remain in the UK after this period has elapsed, EU law forbids systematic checks on whether EU citizens are lawfully residing in the UK.The European Court of Justice has ruled jobseekers cannot be removed irrespective of how long they have been here if they can show they are ‘continuing to seek employment and that has genuine chances of being engaged’.The Home Office was unable to provide a figure for the number of EU migrants removed under the rule.LIE TWO: Turkey - now an ex-Premier lets the cat out of the bagBy Daniel Martin, Chief Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail The Prime Minister is ‘lying to the British people’, it was said last night, after Sir John Major suggested Turkey could join the EU in as little as a decade.Iain Duncan Smith, the Leave campaigner who resigned as Work and Pensions Secretary earlier this year, said former PM Sir John, a staunch Remain backer, had ‘let the cat out of the bag’.It also emerged yesterday that membership talks between the EU and Turkey are due to be reopened next Thursday – a week after the referendum.The pro-Brexit camp has highlighted the possibility of Turkish entry to the EU, saying it could open the doors to hundreds of thousands of workers coming to Britain under free movement rules if we vote to Remain.The Prime Minister is ‘lying to the British people’, it was said last night, after Sir John Major suggested Turkey could join the EU in as little as a decade. Pictured, Mr Cameron with Sir John and Harriet HarmanDavid Cameron claimed earlier this week that membership was not on the cards in the next few decades and that, at current rates, it would not take place until the year 3000. But yesterday, standing alongside Mr Cameron at a Remain campaign event, Sir John said he did not believe that Turkey would join the EU as early as 2026 – but indicated it was a possibility.‘I find it extraordinary that people should point to Turkey, and suggest that 77million Turks are suddenly going to descend and take all of our hospital places and all our school places and all our local authority dwellings,’ he said. ‘They have been negotiating for 30 years without getting in. They are not going to get in, in my judgment, for one, two decades – perhaps not ever.‘Even if it happened in some far distant future, what obscenity it is to suggest all 77million Turks are suddenly going to say, “Let’s go to the United Kingdom, the national minimum wage has risen by 50p, let’s get there as fast as we can.”‘If they do happen to say that, let me just mention to them in advance that they would actually earn more in France or in Germany than they would here.’Yesterday the Prime Minister repeated his prediction that Turkey may not be able to join the EU until the year 3000.Asked about Leave warnings of a potential early accession for Turkey, the PM told LBC radio: ‘The issue simply isn’t going to arise. This is the reddest of red herrings. At the current rate of progress, Turkey could qualify to join in about the year 3000.’ EU leaders pledged in March to speed up Turkey’s long-stalled membership talks as part of an accord on tackling migration.Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘David Cameron has repeatedly claimed that Turkey is not going to join the EU, despite it being Government policy. Now the Turkish government has confirmed that he is the “chief supporter” of their bid to join the EU.‘Cameron also said that Turkey will not join until the year 3000, but Sir John Major has let the cat out of the bag – Turkey could be in the EU in ten years’ time.‘I’m afraid there is no conclusion you can draw from this except that David Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people. Families are suffering the consequences of uncontrolled migration.‘With five countries lining up to join the EU – Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Turkey – this problem can only get worse.’Last night, the Turkish president’s chief adviser, Ilnur Cevik, told BBC2’s Newsnight that Mr Cameron had changed his mind to Turkey’s membership of the EU for political purposes. ‘We thought that Mr Cameron was our chief supporter in our quest for EU membership,’ he said. ‘We are really, really flabbergasted.’LIE THREE: We must not block EU trade, says top German bossGerman industrialist Markus Kerber, pictured, dismissed warnings of a post-Brexit trade warBy Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor for the Daily Mail Germany's leading industrialist yesterday dismissed warnings of a post-Brexit trade war, saying the EU would be ‘very, very foolish’ to impose tariffs on the UK.David Cameron and George Osborne have repeatedly issued doom-laden warnings that British exporters will face a wall of tariffs if Britain leaves the EU, potentially costing jobs.But Markus Kerber, head of the influential BDI which represents German industry, said that made no sense. Mr Kerber told the BBC’s World Service: ‘Imposing trade barriers, imposing protectionist measures between our two countries – or between the two political centres, the EU on the one hand and the UK on the other – would be a very, very foolish thing in the 21st Century.‘The BDI would urge politicians on both sides to come up with a trade regime that enables us to uphold and maintain the levels of trade we have.’Boris Johnson welcomed the intervention, saying it was clear that EU trade partners would be ‘desperate’ for a deal with Britain. The former London Mayor told a BBC debate on Tuesday night that EU countries would be ‘insane’ to erect trade barriers against the UK if it pulled out of the EU, as they sell far more to us than we do to them.Responding to Mr Kerber’s comments yesterday, Mr Johnson said: ‘After the incessant doom-mongering of the In campaign, we now hear the truth from the “voice of German industry” – they would be desperate for free trade after we vote Leave.‘They would be damaging their own commercial interests if they didn’t. That’s why EU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal on Friday.’The assumption that British firms would face tariff barriers has been central to a series of lurid warnings from the Treasury and other bodies that leaving the EU would damage the economy. But Britain’s trade deficit with the EU – the difference between goods imported and exported – hit a record £23.9billion in the first three months of this year, suggesting EU firms would suffer massively in any trade war.Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said: ‘They know they sell twice as many goods to us as we do to them. Who is going to want to wreck that?’One of Britain’s leading entrepreneurs, Sir James Dyson, warned that remaining in the EU ‘would be an act of national self-harm’.LIE FOUR: You won't get more borders reform - EU chief says PM got 'maximum deal'By John Stevens for the Daily Mail Britain will not gain any more reform of immigration rules whether Remain or Leave wins, the EU’s top bureaucrat warned last night.Jean-Claude Juncker flatly rejected making further changes to freedom of movement rules that enable the EU’s 500million citizens to come to the UK.The European Commission president said David Cameron had been given the ‘maximum’ reform he could get in his widely-derided deal with Brussels.Jean-Claude Juncker flatly rejected making further changes to freedom of movement rules that enable the EU’s 500million citizens to come to the UK. Pictured, Mr Juncker with Mr CameronThe Prime Minister has been telling voters he will be able to reform EU migration rules if they choose to vote Remain.The agreement by EU leaders made some changes to benefit entitlements for migrants but did not touch freedom of movement rules.Mr Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, said yesterday: ‘There will be no kind of any negotiation’, adding: [Mr Cameron] got the maximum he could receive, and we gave the maximum we could give, so there will be no kind of renegotiation on the agreement we found in February or as far as any kind of treaty negotiation is concerned. Out is out.’Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron had said: in an interview: ‘Reform doesn’t end on Friday. The only way it ends is if we leave.’ Asked whether he could guarantee he would push for tougher migration controls, he said: ‘Yes of course. This is an ongoing process.’Justice Secretary Michael Gove told voters last night said: ‘If you vote to stay there is no prospect of getting any reform from the EU ever again.‘The Prime Minister tried to get reforms earlier this year but the EU did not listen. The EU cannot and will not give the British people the change that they want.’Boris Johnson, the former London mayor, said: ‘I was very struck to see what President Juncker said – that if Britain thought it was going to get any more change from the EU we had another think coming.’Mr Johnson added: ‘The idea that we can do better by staying in the EU and fighting for change is, I’m afraid, a sham, a snare and a delusion.’Actress Liz Hurley was leaving little to the imagination yesterday... as she encouraged Britain to vote Leave.She urged her social media followers to go for Brexit by releasing a saucy picture of her smiling with just a Union Jack cushion to cover her modesty.The star wrote alongside the image: ‘Vote tomorrow – whatever your persuasion. I’m for #Brexit & promise to neither gloat nor whinge. But VOTE!’Liz Hurley urged her social media followers to go for Brexit by releasing a saucy picture of her smiling with just a Union Jack cushion to cover her modestyMiss Hurley, 51, uploaded the image, taken as a cover shot for the Mail on Sunday’s You Magazine in 2011, to her Twitter and Instagram accounts where it was quickly ‘liked’ and retweeted thousands of times.Some jokingly commented that the cheeky photo of the former model alone was enough to make them vote Leave.On Twitter, one user said: ‘I would say this is the ultimate campaign poster.’Another posted: ‘Thanks Liz, I was going to vote remain, but seeing you with that cushion, I am for Brexit. I am born anew in your wisdom.’IAIN DUNCAN SMITH: What a cynical exercise in hiding the truthToday, the country has the chance to return the Government of Britain back to the UK. More than that, we have the chance to end the corruption of our politics.This corruption of the democratic process is best exemplified by how our leaders have reacted to Turkey’s wish to join the EU.Although he now claims there is no chance of Turkey joining (allowing its 77 million citizens free movement to the UK), why did the Prime Minister refuse on FOUR occasions to say he’d use the British veto to stop it happening? There are several other contradictions.Iain Duncan Smith: 'The country has the chance to return the Government of Britain back to the UK'If Turkey won’t join ‘until about the year 3000’ (as the PM has said), why is there a special team at the British embassy in Ankara helping Turkey to join?And why are hundreds of millions of pounds of British taxpayers’ money being spent to support the accession of Turkey (as well as Albania, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro) to the EU?Equally, why are Brussels officials busy negotiating key financial aspects of Turkey’s accession before Christmas?All this confirms the fact that Turkey’s accession to the European Union is both British and EU policy.Furthermore, the PM knows that the deal struck with the Ankara government earlier this year to stop migrants using Turkey as a jumping-off point to pour into Greece – and thus enable them to travel to any other EU country – was done in exchange for the Turkish government getting £4.6billion in aid (£1billion from the UK), visa-free access for Turks to mainland Europe and accelerated entry to the EU.The Prime Minister is also fully aware that if we try to pull out of the deal, Turkey would inevitably start to allow migrants travelling to EU countries from its shores again – creating similar chaos to that which occurred last year.The truth is that Turkey has the European Union over a barrel and the British Government knows it.Most cynically, the Brussels Commission has been holding back announcements about Turkey until after the UK referendum on membership of the EU. But yesterday the fact was leaked that it will start negotiations on Turkey’s entry into the EU a week today – after the British people have voted.As much as the PM suggests otherwise, the issue of Turkey and the future of its 77 million population ought to be in voters’ minds today as they enter the polling booth.

Set Britain free! Unsure how to vote? This brilliantly incisive verdict from the Spectator, the nation’s foremost political magazine, might help 2016-6-18The Spectator is the oldest continuously published magazine in the English language — having been established in 1828. An intellectual powerhouse of conservative opinion, it is hugely respected on both the Right and Left. This is its editorial ahead of Thursday’s vote... The Spectator has a long record of being isolated, but right. We argued for the decriminalisation of homosexuality a decade before it happened and were denounced as the ‘bugger’s bugle’ for our troubles.We alone supported Margaret Thatcher when she first stood for the Tory leadership.Scroll down for video When Britain last held a referendum in 1975, every newspaper in the land advocated a ‘Yes’ vote. Only two national titles backed what is now called Brexit: the Morning Star and The Spectator. Pictured: The 1975 countAnd when Britain last held a referendum on Europe, every newspaper in the land advocated a ‘Yes’ vote. Only two national titles backed what is now called Brexit: the Morning Star and The Spectator.Our concern then was simple: we did not believe that the Common Market was just about trade. We felt it would be followed by an attempted common government, which would have disastrous effects on a continent distinguished by its glorious diversity.The whole project seemed to be a protectionist scam, an attempt to try to build a wall around the continent rather than embrace world trade.Such European parochialism, we argued, did not suit a globally minded country such as Britain. On the week of the 1975 referendum, The Spectator’s cover line was: ‘Out — and into the world.’We repeat that line today.Since 1975, the EU has mutated in exactly the way we then feared and now resembles nothing so much as the Habsburg Empire in its dying days. A bloated bureaucracy that has outgrown all usefulness. A parliament that represents many nations, but with no democratic legitimacy. Countries on its periphery pitched into poverty, or agitating for secession.The EU’s hunger for power has been matched only by its incompetence. The European Union is making the people of our continent poorer, and less free.This goes far beyond frustration at diktats on banana curvature. The EU has started to deform our government.Michael Gove revealed how, as a Cabinet member, he regularly finds himself having to process edicts, rules and regulations that have been framed at European level. Laws that no one in Britain had asked for, and which no one elected to the House of Commons has the power to change.Leave campaigner Michael Gove says he regularly finds himself having to process edicts, rules and regulations that have been framed at European level - laws no one in Britain has asked forWhat we refer to as British government is increasingly no such thing. It involves the passing of laws written by people whom no one in Britain elected, no one can name and no one can remove.Steve Hilton, David Cameron’s chief strategist for many years, gave an example of this institutional decay.A few months into his job in No 10, he was dismayed to find his colleagues making slow progress because they were all bogged down by paperwork that he didn’t recognise. He asked for an audit, and was shocked by the results: only a third of what the Government was doing was related to its agenda. Just over half was processing orders from Brussels.To him, this was more than just a headache: it was an insidious and accelerating bureaucratic takeover.With the EU’s fundamental lack of democracy comes complacency on the part of its leaders and the corruption of those around them — which has led us to the present situation. Voters are naturally concerned about the extraordinary rise of immigration, and their governments’ inability to control it.Free movement of people might have been a laudable goal before the turn of the century, when the current global wave of migration started. But today, with the world on the move, the system strikes a great many Europeans as madness.The EU’s failure to handle immigration has encouraged the people-trafficking industry, a global evil that has led to almost 3,000 deaths in the Mediterranean so far this year. In theory, the EU is supposed to protect its member states by insisting refugees claim asylum in the first country they enter.In practice, this law — the Dublin Convention — was torn up by Angela Merkel when she recklessly said that all Syrians could settle in Germany if they somehow managed to get there.The EU’s failure to handle immigration has encouraged the people-trafficking industry, a global evil that has led to almost 3,000 deaths in the Mediterranean so far this year. Pictured: Nigel Farage launching a new EU Referendum poster featuring a picture of migrants queueing at a border crossingBlame lies not with the tens of thousands who subsequently arrived, but with a system hopelessly unequal to such a complex, intensifying challenge.The Spectator was, again, alone in the British Press in opposing Britain’s entry to the Exchange Rate Mechanism from the beginning. Why, we asked, should the Bundesbank control another country’s interest rates?When the single currency came along, the risks became greater: what if a country’s economy crashed, but it was denied the stimulus of a devaluing currency?The answer can now be seen across Europe. Sado-austerity in Italy. Youth unemployment of around 50 per cent in Greece and Spain. The evisceration of these economies, in the name of a project supposed to bring people together, has been a tragedy. Last week, a Pew poll showed how far dismay about the EU extends across the Continent.In Greece, 71 per cent now view the EU unfavourably; in France, it’s 61 per cent. In Britain, it was 48 per cent — about the same as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands.Jean-Claude Juncker, the unelected president of the European Commission, has prioritised is the survival of the EU and the single currencyThis was why David Cameron had a strong case for renegotiation: the demand for change was widespread, and growing. A recent poll has suggested that Swedes will vote to leave the EU if Britain does. The absence of a deal worth the name was final proof that the EU is structurally incapable of reform.Jean-Claude Juncker, the unelected president of the European Commission, sees intransigence as a great strength. His priority is the survival of the EU and the single currency: the welfare of Europeans and even the notion of democratic consent seem distant concerns.When he dismisses the ever-louder voices of protest as the shriek of ‘populism’, he echoes the Bertolt Brecht poem: ‘Would it not be easier . . . to dissolve the people and elect another?’ When Britain asked for reform, he took a gamble: that we were bluffing and would not dare to leave. All this has placed the Prime Minister in an impossible position. Unable to make a positive case for staying in the EU, he instead tells us that Britain is trapped within it and that the penalties for leaving are too severe.His scare stories, peppered with made-up statistics, have underlined the emptiness of the case for remaining. It also represents a style of politics that many find repugnant.Warnings from the IMF, OECD and other acronyms have served only to reinforce the caricature of a globalised elite telling the governed what to think.Talk of anyone being made ‘worse off’ by Brexit is deeply misleading. Of the many economists who have made projections for 2030, none have suggested that we’d be poorer.The question is whether we’d be, say, 36 per cent better off or 41 per cent better off by then. Not that anyone knows, given the monstrously large margin of error in 15-year predictions.So these studies offer no real reasons to be fearful. This is perhaps why George Osborne had to resort to concocting figures, such as his now notorious claim that households would be £4,300 worse off. If the economic case against Brexit were so strong, why would the Chancellor have to resort to fabrications?As the world’s fifth-largest economy, Britain has a reasonable chance (to put it mildly) of being able to cut trade deals with countries keen to access our consumers.The worst-case scenario is to use World Trade Organisation rules, tariffs of about 4 per cent. That’s a relatively small mark-up, and the effect would be more than offset by a welcome drop in the pound.And if house prices fall, as the Chancellor predicts, so much the better. A great many would-be homeowners have been praying for just that.George Osborne's prediction that house prices will drop will be welcome news to many would-be homeowners There would certainly be turbulence, which would be the price of our leaving the EU. This would affect City financiers more than the skilled working class (two-thirds of whom support Brexit).This week, we’re being invited to panic at the prospect of a falling pound. But why? A weaker currency would give our exporters the stimulus they need.The question at this referendum is not whether Britain should co-operate with our European allies — the question is how.Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6, has explained how our intelligence alliances are bilateral. Our closest is with the ‘five eyes’ of the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Lancaster House treaties with France over military co-operation are another example.Alliances work when they are between nations with a shared agenda, with the ability and (crucially) the will to act.The EU is an alliance of the unwilling, which is why it is useless on security — as we saw with Bosnia and Libya.Even the migrant crisis has to be handled by Nato, which has been the true guarantor of Western security.It’s sometimes claimed that Vladimir Putin would want Britain to vote for Brexit. This is unlikely: what could suit the Kremlin more than European security being entrusted to the most dysfunctional organisation in the West?As David Cameron rightly says, the British way is to fight, rather than quit. Given the EU has proved that it is structurally incapable of reform, we now have a choice.Do we cave in because we’re too scared to leave? Or do we vote to retrieve our sovereignty, walk away from the whole racket and engage with the world on our own terms?As David Cameron rightly says, the British way is to fight, rather than quit. Given the EU has proved that it is structurally incapable of reform, we now have a choice, writes The SpectatorA vote to leave would represent an extraordinary vote of confidence in the project of the United Kingdom and the principle of national self-determination. It would also show reform-minded Europeans that theirs is not a lost cause. And that we stand willing to help forge a Europe based on freedom, co-operation and sovereignty.The value of sovereignty cannot be measured by any economist’s formula.Adam Smith, the father of economics, first observed that the prosperity of a country is decided by whether it keeps its ‘laws and institutions’ healthy. This basic insight explains why nations thrive or fail, and has been the great secret of British success: intellectual, artistic, scientific and industrial.The principles of the Magna Carta and achievements of the Glorious Revolution led to our emergence as a world power. To pass up the chance to stop our laws being over-ridden by Luxembourg and our democracy eroded by Brussels would be a derogation of duty to this generation and the next.No one — economist, politician or mystic — knows what tumult we can expect in the next 15 years. But we do know that, whatever happens, Britain will be better able to respond and adapt as a sovereign country living under its own laws.The history of the past two centuries can be summed up in two words: democracy matters.Let’s vote to defend it on June 23. 

Cameron insists immigration CAN be curbed within the EU despite near-record figures in bad-tempered interview as referendum campaign enters final stages2016-6-22David Cameron has blamed mass immigration on our 'unnatural' economy as he insisted numbers will be curbed if we stay in the EU.As the referendum campaign enters its final frantic hours, the Prime Minister said freedom of movement rules will be re-examined if we stay in the bloc.He defended his target of bringing net migration down from around 330,000 a year to below 100,000 as 'realistic', and also denied that being in the Brussels club was like being 'shackled to a corpse'.The claims came as both sides in the bitter campaign stepped up their efforts on the eve of the crucial ballot. Mr Cameron, former PM Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet Harman staged a rally in Bristol this morning.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is crossing the country in a helicopter appealing for people to vote for Brexit. David Cameron, former PM Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet Harman appeared together in Bristol to urge a Remain vote in the referendum tomorrowMr Cameron said people should vote to stay in the EU for a 'better future' as he kicked off a frantic final round of campaigning in BristolIn a bad-tempered interview in BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said immigration had been stubbornly running at around three times his target over recent years because it was 'not a normal period'.'As recently as 2008, if you look at the situation of British people and European nationals leaving Britain to go to Europe and European nationals coming to Britain, there was actually net negative migration in terms of Europe,' he said.'We've had an extraordinary five-year period where we've created more jobs than the rest of the European Union put together. Now, that is not a normal period.'Mr Cameron said he believed the UK economy would continue to be strong, adding: 'I also think that the eurozone economies are recovering.'You saw growth of 7 per cent in Ireland last year, you see Spain growing, France growing, Germany growing. So the fact is we've had an unnatural period.'The Prime Minister talks to Charlie Allen, managing director of Shiner, at the company's offices in Bristol this morningMr Cameron inspects a skateboard on a campaign visit in Bristol. He has insisted he will not resign as Prime Minister if there is a Brexit voteOf his net migration target he said: 'It is the right ambition, it is not an unrealistic ambition.'But we shouldn't leave the EU to achieve the ambition.' Mr Cameron pleaded: 'As we try to meet the challenge of immigration, do we want to meet it by leaving the single market and tanking the economy?'He added: 'We are reopening the freedom of movement directive as of the renegotiation.' Mr Cameron denied that Britain was currently 'shackled to a corpse'. 'You can see the European economy's recovery. It's the largest single market in the world,' he said.The PM insisted the UK had a 'special status' within the EU that should not be given up.He also repeated his claim that EU migrants could be sent home after six months if they had not found a job. 'The idea you have to choose between being a success in the European single market of 500 million and campaigning to have jobs and wealth created by trading with other economies - you don't have to choose, you should do both,' he said.'The vision of Britain in Europe is we do have a special status, we have the best of both worlds.'We're in that single market, we're driving that single market, there are lots of things that Britain can help Europe to achieve - whether it's tackling terrorism or signing better trade deals in the future - but we have our own special status protected.James Bond star Daniel Craig (pictured left) revealed his support for Britain staying in the EU after posing in a T-shirt with the slogan: 'No man is an island. No country by itself.'James Bond star Daniel Craig is the latest celebrity to declare his support for Britain staying in the EU. He was pictured last night wearing a white T-shirt with the slogan: 'No man is an island. No country by itself. Vote Remain on 23rd June.' The picture of the retiring James Bond in the pro-EU T-shirt was first published by Turner Prize-winning artist Wolfgang Tillmans, who told his Instagram followers that Craig had sent him the picture. Minutes after the picture appeared online David Cameron tweeted it along with the words: 'It's great to see Daniel Craig is planning to Vote Remain on Thursday.' It delivers another boost to the Remain campaign after the endorsements of David and Victoria Beckham urged voters to support staying in the EU 'for our children'.The England footballing hero and his fashion designer wife said Britain should be facing the challenges of the world together with its allies. He was joined by his former England colleague Rio Ferdinand, who compared EU membership to playing the success they achieved at Manchester United.  'I'm a deeply patriotic person about this country. We have not been invaded for 1,000 years, we've got institutions that have served us well. I don't want to give that up to some sort of 'United Europe' and that's not what we're going to do.'We're out of the euro, out of ever-closer union, we're proud Brits and really proud of what our country can achieve, but, frankly, we achieve more if we're in these organisations fighting for British interests and British values rather than standing outside for them.'After a series of tetchy exchanges with presenter John Humphrys, the PM jibed: 'You will interrupt yourself John in a minute if you don't watch out.' Asked if he would continue to be PM regardless of the result, Mr Cameron replied: 'I will accept the instructions of the British people and get to work on Friday morning to deliver them.'During the rally in Bristol Sir John took a swipe at Mr Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove, suggesting he had 'expected better' from them.Quitting the European Union will not stem immigration and risks creating a broken Britain, he insisted.Leaving would be a 'disproportionate' response to migration concerns and the country would live to regret it for a 'long time to come'. He said: 'If our nation does vote to leave, we must respect their decision, but if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the grave-diggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer.''They will have to account for what they have said and done but that will be of little consolation for we will be out, out for good, diminished as an influence on the world. 'A truly Great Britain shrunk down to a little England perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales, and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south by the border the controls that would then be the edge of the European Union.'Dismissing accusations that the Remain campaign had been 'project fear', he insisted that Mr Cameron had a 'duty' to to warn the nation of the dangers of quitting.He said: 'In return for doing that he has faced a great deal of opposition and sometimes abuse from people who, frankly, we might have expected better from.'I think the way in which he has conducted himself in putting the country before self and the country before party is quite remarkable.'Mr Johnson was involved in brutal clashes with Sadiq Khan and fellow Tory Ruth Davidson during the BBC special last night.He laid into the Remain side for 'talking the country down' by issuing a slew of dire Project Fear warnings about the consequences of cutting ties with Brussels.But newly-installed London Mayor Mr Khan hit back by accusing him of telling 'lie after lie' and running 'Project Hate', while Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson lashed out at him for trying to turn the programme into 'the Boris show'. Mr Johnson was joined by Tory Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom and Labour's Gisela Stuart for the programme in front of a 6,000 strong live audience.Alongside Mr Khan were Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson and TUC Secretary General Frances O'Grady. Taking to the stage in London last night, Mr Khan said the country would face the 'most important decision for a generation' on Thursday.A Remain vote would mean people are 'both better off and safer'.Audience member Maxine Fothergill said she was a small business owner employing 10 staff and told the panelists that her firm was one of many in the UK that were 'stifled' by EU regulation. Ms Davidson said she knew the EU was 'a bit frustrating but what it means is you cannot be undercut'.She insisted that tariffs and taxes would be increased if we were outside the EU.But Mr Johnson laughed off the idea of tariffs, arguing that Germany sold a fifth of its car output in the UK.'I must say that I think that it was extraordinary to hear that we would have tariffs imposed on us because everybody knows that this country receives about a fifth of Germany's entire car manufacturing output - 820,000 vehicles a year,' he said. Former PM Sir John Major joined Mr Cameron and Mrs Harman at a Remain rally in Bristol todayDavid Cameron and Labour's Harriet Harman visit the premises of sports equipment distributor Shiner in Bristol today as the referendum campaign enters its final frantic stagesMeanwhile, the bosses of more than half of Britain's biggest businesses have urged voters to avoid causing economic chaos by voting to stay in the EU in tomorrow's historic referendum.In the largest business endorsement of the bitter campaign so far, 1,285 bosses representing 51 of the FTSE 100 firms that a vote to leave the EU would cost jobs, trigger uncertainty and less trade for Britain.And in a letter in The Times today, the bosses of 1,285 firms that employ 1.75million people write: 'Britain leaving the EU would mean uncertainty for our firms, less trade with Europe and fewer jobs. 'Britain remaining in the EU would mean the opposite – more certainty, more trade and more jobs. 'EU membership is good for business and good for British jobs.

EU referendum battle is effectively put on hold until Tuesday as parliament is recalled for tributes on Monday2016-6-17The EU referendum battle has been put on hold as a mark of respect following the death of Jo Cox.The campaigns called a truce as David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn headed to the scene of the brutal killing to lay flowers and express their outrage.Activities are likely to be minimal over the weekend and on Monday, when parliament has been recalled so MPs can pay tribute to their colleague. Carrying bouquets and accompanied by Commons Speaker John Bercow, the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition made a sombre appearance at an impromptu memorial to the late Batley and Spen MP.Mother-of-two Mrs Cox was repeatedly shot and stabbed to death in broad daylight yesterday lunchtime as she arrived for her regular constituency surgery at Birstall Library.Following the death of Labour MP Jo Cox (pictured) Boris Johnson abandoned a battle bus tour of East Anglia  yesterday and Prime Minister David Cameron has cancelled a pro-EU rally in GibraltarThe unprecedented gathering saw Mr Cameron and Mr Corbyn stand shoulder to shoulder to mark the outpouring of grief in Westminster following the shocking killing yesterday.Mr Cameron said: 'Where we see hatred, where we see division, where we see intolerance we must drive it out of our public life and politics.'He said: 'If we truly want to honour Jo, then what we should do is recognise that her values - service, community, tolerance - the values she lived by and worked by, those are the values that we need to redouble in our national life in the months and years to come.'Mr Corbyn said: 'This was an attack on democracy, it was a well of hatred that killed her.'  Commons Speaker John Bercow said: 'Evil cannot be allowed and will not be allowed to triumph over good.'We just have to underline our determination as politicians across the spectrum that free speech and the right of people to go about their business and the pursuit of principle will continue, and it will not be dulled or dimmed or cowed in any way by people who think that violence and the spirit of hatred can be allowed to triumph.'The Prime Minister said the nation was 'rightly shocked' at her death, adding: 'Two children have lost their mother, a husband has lost a loving wife and Parliament has lost one of its most passionate and brilliant campaigners.'Standing alongside Mr Cameron today, Mr Corbyn said: 'We need our whole society to be secure.'Jo was brutally murdered here 24 hours ago in this town - a town she loved, a town she grew up in, serving a community she loved.Pictured arriving for the memorial today were, from left, Mr Benn, Mr Bercow, Mr Cameron, Commons chaplain Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Mr Corbyn'And in her life she'd worked for anti-slavery campaigns, she'd worked for Oxfam, she was a campaigner for human rights and justice all around the world.'She was taken from us in an act of hatred, in a vile act that has killed her.' Boris Johnson abandoned a battle bus tour of East Anglia as news of the attack on Mrs Cox filtered through yesterday lunchtime.David Cameron, who had travelled to Gibraltar, also cancelled a planned pro-EU rally in the overseas territory. The Chancellor had been expected to issue a fresh warning about the economic impact of leaving the EU.Instead he paid tribute to Mrs Cox, saying her campaigning stance on issues such as Syria and refugees had helped ‘transform’ many lives.Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, Mr Corbyn, Commons Speaker John Bercow and Mr Cameron paused for a moment to pay their respects after placing tributes and making brief remarks The Chancellor also highlighted the value of the ‘everyday accessibility’ of MPs to their constituents – and vowed that it would continue despite the ‘injury and intimidation’ faced by some.He added: ‘People are free in this country to live their lives as they choose and express themselves without fear. Society will protect their right to do so and hold to account those who disregard our laws.‘Today’s horrible events are an assault on all of these values. But we know that these values, no matter how they have been challenged in the past, have always prevailed.’Mrs Cox’s violent death is likely to calm the tone of the referendum debate in the final days of campaigning.US Secretary of State John Kerry described the killing as an ‘assault on democracy’.Former US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting in Arizona in 2011, said: ‘Absolutely sickened to hear of the assassination of Jo Cox. She was young, courageous and hardworking. A rising star, mother and wife.’Former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said: ‘My heart breaks for the loss of Jo Cox and for Brendan and their kids. She was so full of joy. Words feel hopeless right now.’Former premier Tony Blair said: ‘Such a pointless and savage act of hatred contradicts everything Jo lived for and worked for. She is a huge loss to British politics.’ Tributes grew today at an informal memorial to the late MP on Parliament Square today as scores of flowers were laid around a portrait of the 41-year-old 

'The people have spoken up for democracy': Boris Johnson thanks voters for backing Brexit but insists we will be 'no less European' outside the EU2016-6-24Boris Johnson thanked voters for trusting his plan to leave the EU today and sought to reassure young Remain voters by saying we will be no less European despite cutting ties with Brussels.He insisted there was no need for 'haste' in the process of officially withdrawing from the EU as he appealed for calm and sought to reassure fears over economic and political uncertainty. After the EU referendum results delivered a shock win for Brexit in the early hours of this morning, Mr Johnson said the EU was 'a noble idea for its time' but was 'not longer right for this country'. Brussels was 'too remote, too opaque and not not accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve,' the former Mayor of London added as he hailed the 'glorious opportunity' that quitting the EU gave the UK. And he delivered a stirring pitch to be Prime Minister of a new 'great' Britain outside the EU following David Cameron's dramatic announcement earlier this morning that he will step down within three months. Boris Johnson (pictured delivering a statement at a Vote Leave press conference in central London this morning) thanked voters for trusting his plan to leave the EU today and sought to reassure Remain voters that Britain will be no less European despite cutting ties with BrusselsBoris Johnson is driven away from his home in north London this morning and made the short trip to Westminster, where he gave a press conference with fellow Brexit campaigners to set out an outline of their plans for life outside the EU Mr Cameron will stay on as Prime Minister for three months to calm the markets and allow the Conservative party to elect a new leader. Mr Johnson is the overwhelming favourite to win the leadership election and subsequently become the next PM. The new leader is expected to be installed in Downing Street by the time of the Conservative party conference at the beginning of October. But whoever it is will have a very tough two years ahead of them as they lead negotiations to establish a new relationship with the EU. Making his first appearance in public after the historic four-point win for Leave in yesterday's referendum, a humbled Mr Johnson said all politicians 'should thank the British people because in a way they have been doing our job for us'.'They hire us to deal with the hard questions and this year we gave them one of the biggest and toughest questions of all,' he added. Mr Johnson stood alongside his fellow Vote Leave leaders - the Labour MP Gisela Stuart and Justice Secretary Michael Gove to set out their vision for Britain outside the EU at a press conference in central London this morning.'I believe we now have a glorious opportunity. We can pass our laws, set our taxes, entirely according to the needs of the UK economy,' he said. 'We can control our own borders, in a way that is not discriminatory but fair, and balanced and take the wind out of the sales of the extremists and those who would play politics of immigration.Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

In Britain and across Europe.'I think we can be very proud of the result.' Mr Johnson is likely to play a central role in negotiations with the EU from now on having spearheaded the campaign to leave the EU. Lord Feldman will leave Downing Street with David Cameron after announcing he was quitting as Tory chairman Conservative Party chairman Andrew Feldman will step down when the Prime Minister leaves Downing Street later this year.David Cameron has asked Lord Feldman to stay on while the party elects a new leader, which is expected to take place before the autumn conference.Lord Feldman, one of David Cameron's closest friends, has been embroiled in both the scandal over bullying within Tory ranks and the investigations into general election expense declarations. A Conservative spokeswoman said: 'Andrew Feldman always said that he would serve alongside the Prime Minister for as long as he was needed.'The Prime Minister has asked him to stay as chairman of the Conservative Party whilst the leadership campaign takes place.'He will ensure that the party conference is properly delivered in the autumn.'Lord Feldman will step down when the Prime Minister leaves Downing Street.'Lord Feldman was seen visiting Downing Street on Friday morning shortly before Mr Cameron announced his resignation.But he echoed Mr Cameron this morning in stressing there was no need to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out the formal process of officially quitting the EU.  ‘In voting to leave the EU it is vital to stress there is now no need for haste and, indeed, as the Prime minister has just said, nothing will change over the short term except that work will have to begin on how to give effect to the will of the people and to extricate this country from the supranational system.‘As the prime minister has rightly said, there is no need to invoke article 50.’  Mr Johnson finally emerged from his north London home this morning after a growing media scrum and members of the public gathered outside. But he said nothing as he walked straight to the waiting car for the short trip to Westminster, where he met with fellow Vote Leave campaigners before staging a press conference with Labour MP Gisela Stuart and Justice Secretary Michael Gove - both of whom played key roles in winning the referendum.  Mr Johnson was booed and mobbed by members of the public who accompanied the media scrum outside his house in the Angel neighborhood of Islington, north London. One onlooker shouted 't***' and another labelled the former Mayor of London 'scum' as he appeared at his front door, flanked by several police officers who escorted him to a waiting car. As he was driven away through dozens of journalists and photographers, more members of the public joined in the heckling.His car didn't get far before it was trapped once again - this time by a crowd of around 40 cyclists and onlookers blocking a junction.His vehicle was halted for around five minutes and police officers, who had been guarding his home, were nowhere to be seen.The crowd taunted him with shouts of 'where are you going, Boris?' and 'scum!' and hurled other profanities as his car was trapped in front of a green light, unable to move.One man yelled: 'The pound is down, what do you say about that? Is it going to be all right, Boris? Is the UK going to be all right, Boris? Are we going to be all right, mate? Come on, man up.'Although the crowds had Mr Johnson's car stuck in the road, they did not appear to approach it.Officers eventually arrived at the junction around 200 metres from his house, where they had been controlling a media scrum and crowds of onlookers.There were cries of 'shame' as the car, with tinted windows, was eventually freed and moved off.Mr Johnson eventually arrived at Leave headquarters on the Embankment at around 10am but swept in through a back entrance, avoiding dozens of press reporters, photographers and video journalists who had been braced to expect his arrival at the front of the building.This morning was an example of the type of media blitz that awaits Mr Johnson over the coming weeks and months. Mr Johnson made a notable and direct appeal to young voters, who overwhelmingly backed remaining in the EU in yesterday's referendum. He said their right and freedom to travel across Europe will not be hindered by Brexit and urged them to be optimistic about Britain's future out of the EU.  But he has a tough task ahead of him to win over the youth vote, with initial forecasts suggesting three in four 18-24-year-olds voted for Remain in the referendum and more than half (56 per cent) of 25-49-year-olds backing the pro-EU option. Mr Johnson said: ‘I want to speak directly to the millions of people who did not vote for this outcome, especially young people, who may feel this decision in some way involves pulling up a draw bridge or any kind of isolationism.‘I think the very opposite is true. We cannot turn our backs of Europe, we are part of Europe. Our children and our grandchildren will have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling to the continent, understanding the languages, and cultures that make up our common European civilisation.’  He also paid tribute to the outgoing Prime Minister and said he was 'sad' to learn he was stepping down.Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

Both posters got a huge cheer and round of applause. 'Boris wasn't telling people who to vote for, just for them to get out there and make the effort.'  Boris Johnson turned out to vote tonight in London tonight after attending his daughter's graduation one defiant student defied his pro-Brexit claims at the event Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

But on the day Britain backed Brexit is anything impossible? THERESA MAYAfter six years as Home Secretary, Theresa May is the sober, serious choice - and probably the strongest 'continuity candidate' who could succeed Cameron.May has become the longest serving Home Secretary, thriving in a brief which has proved the graveyard for many a political career. Tough, a safe pair of hands and widely respected - if not always seen fondly - May could be the anti-Boris.STEPHEN CRABBPerhaps the biggest unknown in the race, the work and pensions secretary was parachuted into the top of front line politics as the replacement for Iain Duncan Smith after his bombshell resignation over the Budget.Crabb, a Welsh son of a broken home, could be the leading One Nation candidate in the leadership race.Being a new name - and one who was quiet in the referendum - could allow Crabb to define himself a unifying candidate. LIAM FOX A heavy weight with Cabinet experience, Fox has run for the leadership before - and lost.But he is extremely popular on the right of the party and played a leading role in referendum campaign, appearing with different parts of the Leave movement.The former defence secretary is known to have a war chest ready and waiting for the leadership campaign and is well connected on the Tory benches.While it is perhaps hard to see a route onto the final shortlist, Fox would undoubtedly be well organised and a fearsome candidate.  

Nearly half a million less jobs, 5% lower GDP and £40bn black hole in the public finances: Osborne's Brexit by numbers as he issues stark warning to leave voters  2016-6-18On Thursday, I was sitting in my study in Number 11, finishing writing the speech I was planning to give to the annual Mansion House dinner, when a colleague came in to tell me that Jo Cox MP had been attacked.Like so many others, I watched the news hoping and praying for the best and then feeling numb with shock when the terrible news came through that Jo had died.Looking at the beautiful photo that her husband, Brendan, posted of Jo, my first thoughts were about the senseless loss of a young woman’s life and for the two children who had lost their mother. Then it began to sink in that her murder was also an assault on the values that have made Great Britain great: freedom, liberty, tolerance, Parliamentary democracy itself.Chancellor George Osborne predicts economic ruin if the nation votes in favour of Brexit on Thursday So that evening, I tore up the economic speech I was going to give and instead addressed the appalling loss of Jo Cox.Campaigning in the EU referendum was suspended on both sides as a mark of respect for Jo. Today it restarts, as we engage in the democratic debate that she so proudly served.Jo campaigned on many important causes in her short time in Parliament – from banishing modern slavery to helping the families displaced by the conflict in Syria.But her last political platform was on the Thames, where her family – Brendan and their two small children – joined a flotilla flying flags for Remain.We each have the same one vote in this referendum. And there are strong feelings on both sides.But I hope, in Jo’s memory, that the campaign can be conducted between now and Thursday in less divisive a tone than we have seen so far. Let’s have less inflammatory rhetoric and baseless assertion, and more facts and reasoned argument.Today, I want to make the argument about our place in Europe that I would have made to the Mansion House.We’ve fought hard to get this country growing again. This week we learned of a record number of people in work and unemployment at an 11-year low. Wages are rising, living standards are going up, and we can fund increases for the NHS and defence.Mr Osborne said he tore up an economic speech he was due to deliver on Thursday following Jo Cox's murderI am not saying everything is perfect in our economy, but I see no evidence that quitting the EU will solve any problems we have. Is there too much red tape for business? Yes, but the Dutch have less red tape and manage to achieve that inside the EU. Do we need to sell more to places like China? Yes, but the Germans sell three times more than we do to China and they are inside the EU. Do we pool our sovereignty inside the EU? Yes, but we do in NATO and the UN too, because it gives us more not less control over our lives.The one thing everyone is agreed on is that quitting the EU would bring us a lot more uncertainty. Many believe it could take us a decade to exit.A decade of firms not knowing the trading arrangements with our largest markets; when small firms aren’t sure what standards their products should meet; when big investors into Britain think twice whether they invest any more.This is what companies like Hitachi and Rolls-Royce and entrepreneurs like Richard Branson and Bill Gates are spelling out for us.In the past 72 hours, we’ve heard from impeccably independent institutions set up precisely to warn us about economic risks. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee said voting to leave the EU could lead to a sharp fall in sterling, higher prices, lower growth and rising unemployment and is the largest immediate risk facing not just Britain’s financial markets, but global markets too.The International Monetary Fund estimated Britain’s GDP could be over five per cent lower; inflation over one per cent higher; wages would be depressed and unemployment could rise by 1.4 per cent.That’s 440,000 more out of work; 440,000 families who’ve lost their economic security. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies says this kind of hit to the economy means less money coming into the Treasury and so less money for public services.There would be a hole in the public finances of between £20 billion to £40 billion. A permanent hole that would have to be filled by higher taxes and spending cuts.So what has been the Leave campaign’s response to this? Down with the experts! We don’t want to hear the facts.It means we shouldn’t listen to people who know what they’re talking about; we should only listen to those who don’t.I find this deeply troubling. Never before in British politics has independent, impartial, expert analysis been so necessary. If we quit the EU, there is no going back. We can’t turn around in a couple of years and say: we’ve made a mistake; please let us back in. The referendum is also about who we are as a country.It was Winston Churchill who said: ‘A nation that forgets its past has no future.’Engagement with the world and a free trading spirit are woven into the fabric of our nation. Britons have made friends, built alliances and traded all across Europe, spilled blood in the cause of freedom on our Continent.It was our thinkers and philosophers who developed theories of free trade, and our political leaders who were the first in the world to put them into practice. It was Britain that helped create the Council of Europe in 1949 as our Continent reeled from the horrors of the Nazis; Britain which built the single market championed by Margaret Thatcher, perhaps the greatest achievement of free trade in the history of the world.That’s why I believe so profoundly, with all my heart, that a vote to Leave the EU would be the most terrible mistake for our country.And it would not be in keeping with who we are as a people. Not the British way. When something isn’t perfect, like the EU, we get stuck in trying to improve it. We are not quitters.So I say to people weighing up how to vote on Thursday. Stop and think. If there’s any doubt in your mind, don’t take the risk with an irreversible vote to Leave.Instead, let’s heed Churchill’s advice, and not forget our past. Let’s vote to Remain. Let’s be Great Britain, our great democracy.

Commuters said they were evacuated from trains and continued their journey by busA couple set to be first-time parents in a month have been made homeless after flooding ravaged their ground-floor flat.David Sandor and his wife Lidia, who is eight months pregnant, are due to have their first child on July 24 but now have to leave their Essex home for up to two months.David's sister, Elizabeth Bodea, 28, who lives in a flat upstairs in the same block in Romford with her husband and another brother, said: 'The rain started around 1am and around 3am the ground floor was flooded because the drainage couldn't cope.'It was pouring like I have never seen in my life. We phoned the emergency services but they said they had to go to people in greater need.'I am worried about my sister-in-law because I wanted to be there to help her with the baby. They have just bought all the baby stuff and some of it was damaged.'Thankfully most of it was upstairs as the flat is two floors but their kitchen is destroyed.'Mrs Bodea shared a photo on social media of cars, including hers, submerged in flood water outside Linton Court.Flooding overnight led to voters having to wade through water to cast their votes in today's EU in/out referendum. The rain was still coming down this morning as polls opened across the country.And the rising waters eventually led to one polling station having to be abandoned and relocated after the inside of the building became flooded.The first voters to turn up to their local polling booth in Devon Way, Chessington, Surrey, were able to get inside to put a cross in their in/out box - but only after first wading through huge puddles.However heavy rain persisted and the puddles eventually enveloped the inside of the building - forcing council bosses to relocate the polling booth to the nearby Hook Centre.Kingston Council also shut the polling station at the Shiraz Mirza community hall in Malden Manor, telling voters to instead head to the Lawrence Avenue Children's Centre.On the roads, floodwater led to delays on the M23 near junction 9 at Gatwick, the A24 near Morden and the M25 anti-clockwise near junction 11 at Chertsey.On the M4 a car was reported to have spun off in the road in surface water between Windsor and Langley, while a crash between Witney and Burford left the A40 closed in both directions.RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: 'We have seen a massive uplift in calls for help, with hundreds of extra breakdowns in London, Kent and East Anglia as motorists suffer the consequences of flash floods and the knock-on traffic delays.'Alternative routes have become badly affected by the sheer volume of vehicles as drivers try to avoid the jams, and sadly this has led to yet more breakdowns.'In the South West, the situation around Glastonbury continues to be a challenge and we are working to help those who have broken down en route to the festival.' The Blackwall Tunnel, which connects north and south London, was also closed over flooding fears. But fortunately for music fans at Glastonbury the storm just missed Worthy Farm in Somerset. After yesterday's heavy rain and traffic jams brought chaos to the first day of arrivals, thousands of festival-goers celebrated the end of the rain which had turned the site into a boggy mess.However the festival could face additional chaos today as thousands more ticket-holders turn up at the isolated farm where it is held, causing huge hold-ups on the roads. Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

We are dealing with it as best we can. The surrounding roads are flooded and a juror has been stuck in traffic for four hours.'Meanwhile, weather experts said there were more than 6,000 lightning strikes over the south east of England last night.  In just one hour, 20.5mm of rain fell in Bexley, East London, close to half the June average, with some parts expected to see multiple showers bringing a month's rain on Thursday morning.Rail passengers heading into London were left stranded on a train for more than two hours during this morning's rush hour commute after another train pushed a fallen tree into its path.Commuters were left stuck on board after the fallen tree became tangled up in the train wheels - leaving it, and them, unable to move anywhere.Passengers had to wait for engineers to be called out to free the stricken train before they could get going again.The fallen tree led to the line between Wokingham and Bracknell, Berkshire, being blocked in both directions.The blockage was on a busy commuter route between Reading, Berkshire, and London and had a knock-on effect for passengers waiting for trains at other stations. In Winnersh, Berkshire, some drivers were forced to re-route via Bracknell, around five miles away, after fallen power lines blocked roads and caused chaos on bus routes.The Environment Agency has issued four flood warnings covering rivers in Bromley, Sidcup and Basildon, and 22 flood alerts across of the South East.There are seven flood warnings covering rivers in London and Essex, and around 40 flood alerts across the South East.A number of rivers in the region have hit their highest level on record over the past 24 hours.These include the River Rom, the River Wandle, Beverley Brook at Wimbledon, the River Shuttle at Bexley, River Ravensbourne at Bromley and the River Ingrebourne near Rainham, Essex.   An amber weather warning for rain has been issued by the Met Office for Hertfordshire, Essex and Thurrock on Thursday afternoon and evening, while a yellow warning covering the South East is in place until Friday.  Forecaster Luke Miall said: 'If you draw a line from The Wash to the Isle of Portland everything east of that is in the firing line.'A band of showers is coming across the English Channel and moving north-eastwards, that will bring some heavy downpours and localised surface flooding. There's going to be a bit of hail in there too, so there's quite a lot going on.'If you're in the South East, you definitely need your umbrella and possibly a pair of Wellington boots.'  Doug Wilson, Environment Agency flood risk manager, said: 'Torrential downpours across the South East, including London, could lead to further surface water flooding and significant disruption to travel on Thursday.'He added: 'If travelling, we urge people not to drive through flood water - it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm (1ft) of flowing water is enough to float your car.'  Roads in Battersea, south-west London, Barking in East London and Lewisham were under several inches of water.Louise March tweeted that there was serious flooding in the Longbridge Road area of Barking and she was concerned over her property insurance.She wrote: 'I saw a car under water people helping to push it out if the water never seen this in the 15 years I've lived here.'Mother-of-two Jodie Rose, 37, from Barking, Essex, said flooding in her road following the heavy rain would hit voter turnout.Mrs Rose, who is on maternity leave, said that the floodwater in her front and back gardens contained sewage and her children were unable to go to school as a result.'We can't go outside into the garden, obviously, and the children are not at school today. It being polling day as well, I'm sure it's going to have a big effect on Barking voters.'Mrs Rose, a teacher, said: 'My Nan is 89 years of age and she's already said that she won't be going out to vote.'She said the water was knee-deep around her grandmother's house and that the pensioner would not take the 'risk' of going out to vote.Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

'She said that she won't be able to get out if it doesn't subside a little bit.'Mrs Rose, who has lived in Barking all her life, said she had never seen anything like it and that the flooding would make it difficult to reach the polling station.'We're hoping it (the water) won't come inside my house but I feel sorry for my neighbours a few doors away - it's definitely in theirs already.'In Surbiton, south west London, a manhole overflowed so much that it was spurting water in the rain.Police officers filmed water bursting from beneath the metal cap, as 50mm of rain fell in just 60 minutes on Wednesday night.Kingston police officers tweeted the 17-second clip with the caption: 'The flooding was so bad in Surbiton it created this dancing man hole cover.'A number of thunderstorm videos were also posted by Twitter user @Yathiinn_LK, while Julian Gregory published footage on Instagram of a lightning bolt striking The Gherkin in central London and Gareth Watkins tweeted video of the bad weather hitting Clapham.Couple lucky to survive after lightning causes a tree to 'explode' and sends part of it hurtling through a bedroom window just inches from their bedA couple were inches away from death when a huge log smashed through their bedroom window after lightning caused a tree to 'explode'.As storms battered southern England overnight, pieces of wood 'bigger than people' were sent flying through the air when a lightning bolt struck a 100ft tree in the early hours.Josh Roles was in bed with his girlfriend Rhiannon Depla when a 4ft log crashed through their window landing inches away from their bed.The 23-year-old, who works as an engine technician at McLaren, said: 'The lightning was getting closer and closer, one was really close then the next one hit the tree and our window just smashed and a log came through.A couple were inches away from death when a huge log smashed through their bedroom window after lightning caused a tree to 'explode'Lucky: Josh Roles was in bed with his girlfriend Rhiannon Depla (pictured) when a 4ft log crashed through their window landing inches away from their bed.

'Brexit is proof that Trump will be the next president': 'Anti-immigration' message and shift to the Right that led to UK's seismic break with Europe draws parallels with rise of The Donald2016-6-24As Donald Trump flew in to Scotland today after the UK's seismic break with the European Union, parallels have been drawn with the anti-immigration message that led to Brexit and his rise to presumptive Republican presidential candidate. Many have pointed out the similarities between Britain's decision to leave the EU and Trump's campaign - and believe it is an indication of how Americans will vote on November 8, which could see Trump in the White House.The Donald's arrival in the UK will be seen by many as a meeting of minds - two worlds colliding with shared views including a disgruntled electorate; lost national pride; isolationism; and the issue of immigration.However, he may not get the desired reception in Scotland: while voters in England and Wales swung the result for Leave, Scots voted overwhelmingly for remaining part of the EU. And today, he promised close ties between the U.S. and UK if he becomes President, saying: 'A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense'. 'Brexit is further proof that Donald J Trump will be the next President of the United States,' wrote Broderick Greer on Twitter. Scroll down for video Twitter drew parallels with the 'anti-immigration' message that led to Brexit with the meteoric rise of the Donald TrumpThe people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples. They have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy. A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense. The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration.Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first. They will have the chance to reject today’s rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.I hope America is watching, it will soon be time to believe in America again.Paul Harris added that Americans should learn a lesson from the result in Britain.'If you think Trump can't win you are lazy, complacent and very dangerous,' he warned.Arnivan Ghosh said Trump should look for tips from Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party who has spent 20 years campaigning to the country to leave the EU, on how to win with a 'divisive, anti-immigration' message. 'That Nigel dude is British Trump,' added Wanda Sykes.Huw James Collins added: 'The correlation of Trump enthusiasts delighting in the 'Leave' victory perfectly illuminates the roots of this debacle.'Others were concerned that the result will lend credence to Trump's nationalistic agenda and mean other nations turn to isolationist policies.'Deeply concerned that #Brexit will cue other nations to recede into isolationism, and lend credence to #Trump's nativist agenda,' wrote Guy Wilson.Many have warned that this nationalist drive now sets the world stage for a Donald Trump presidency.In an op-ed for the LA Times, London School of Economics fellow Brian Klaas and Marcel Dirsus, a lecturer at the University of Kiel in Germany, compare Brexit voters to 'Trump supporters sporting "Make America Great Again" hats' who 'believe they have lost too much for too long'. 'Their complaint is understandable,' they write. 'But turning inward will only make their problems worse and the world more dangerous. 'Britain narrowly succumbed to isolationist populism Thursday. Let’s hope Americans don’t make the same mistake by voting for a Trump presidency come November.' Meanwhile, BBC World News anchor Katty Kay, an English journalist now based in Washington, said that if ‘disgruntlement, nationalism, populism and anti-globalization’ are enough to force a radical move in the UK, then it could be the same in the United States. She highlighted five reasons why Brexit could mean the billionaire businessman winning the White House in November: an angry electorate, globalization, immigration, lost pride and populism.Twitter has been flooded with those comparing the Brexit campaign's 'divisive' anti-immigration message with the meteoric rise of The DonaldMany on Twitter believing the result it's a sign that Trump will be the next president of the United States‘The two most surprising political phenomena of this year have been the rise of Donald Trump and the success of the Leave Europe camp in Britain’s referendum on Brexit,’ she wrote in an article published earlier this week. Kay notes that few pundits saw either coming, including herself, but believes the result in Britain could indicate how America votes in the November 8 election.She compared Donald Trump’s tactic of tapping into the angry electorate with Boris Johnson, the former Mayor of London who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU. ‘Mr Johnson promises Brits a better deal if they throw off the onerous yoke of EU regulations. Mr Trump promises Americans a better deal if they put him in the White House.’ 

PM uses Twitter to highlight Jo Cox's final defence of the EU as former Tory minister claims Remain side are trying to 'spin' her killing to win referendum2016-6-19Labour MP Jo Cox, who was killed last week. The elected member evoked strong pro-EU viewsDavid Cameron yesterday evoked the pro-EU views of murdered MP Jo Cox amid a continuing row over whether the tragedy was being politicised.On Twitter, the Prime Minister highlighted the final article written by the Labour MP, in which she warned voters not to ‘fall for the spin’ that quitting the EU would solve concerns over immigration.Mr Cameron praised her ‘strong voice’ in the referendum campaign and said it would be ‘badly missed’ in the closing days.Stronger In campaigners said that by linking to her article, the Prime Minister was simply ensuring her voice would be heard.But the intervention came amid clashes over whether Mrs Cox’s death was being politicised.At lunchtime, pro-Brexit Labour MP Kate Hoey told a rally: ‘Jo was a democrat and she would want this referendum campaign to continue, and she would want no one to link anything around this referendum with that terrible tragedy.’Mrs Cox’s final article was re-published yesterday in several newspapers and by the Stronger In campaign. Alongside a link to it, the Prime Minister tweeted: ‘Jo Cox’s strong voice in the campaign to remain in the EU will be badly missed.’ In the piece, Mrs Cox wrote: ‘There is now an unprecedented consensus that leaving the EU would hurt our economy and hit our pockets.‘We cannot allow voters to fall for the spin that a vote to leave is the only way to deal with concerns about immigration.‘We can do far more to address both the level and impact of immigration while remaining in the EU. I very rarely agree with the Prime Minister but on this he’s right: we are stronger, safer and better off in.’However, the row came after a former defence minister lashed out at pro-EU figures for trying to 'spin' the tragic killing of Jo Cox in a bid to win the referendum.On Twitter, the Prime Minister highlighted the final article written by the Labour MP, in which she warned voters not to ‘fall for the spin’ on quitting the EU Tory MP Andrew Murrison tweeted the comment as polls showed the race was neck and neck again after a surge for Remain.However, soon afterwards he deleted the post and replaced it with one that urged both sides to put their cases 'squarely, honestly and decently'.Mr Cameron praised Mrs Cox's ‘strong voice’ in the referendum campaign and said it would be ‘badly missed’ in the closing daysCampaigning resumed yesterday after being put on hold in the aftermath of the fatal attack on Mrs Cox, a strong supporter of Britain staying in the EU.The man charged with her murder, Thomas Mair, gave his name as 'death to traitors, freedom for Britain' when he appeared in court on Saturday.A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday found Remain had opened up a three-point lead on 45 per cent to 42 per cent - reversing the firm's findings from Thursday.Another showed the two sides are level while a third has voters saying they are more enthusiastic about leaving the EU than staying.Pollsters have suggested that the apparent surge for Remain could be down to undecided voters plumping for the status quo as the crucial ballot looms.But Mr Murrison complained that pro-EU figures may be exploiting the tragedy to bolster support for ties with Brussels.'Remain side spinning Jo Cox murder for partisan advantage in #EUReferendum shameful,' he wrote on Twitter.Within hours the MP had deleted the post and replaced it with one that said: 'Can both sides in this horrible #EUReferendum campaign & the press use the last few days to put case squarely, honestly and decently?'Pro-EU figures have stressed the need for unity and condemned the tone of the campaign in the wake of the killing.In a letter to the Observer today, Tony Blair, ex-deputy PM Nick Clegg and Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine say the vote is about 'what sort of country we are'.The message - which was highlighted on Twitter by David Cameron - said: 'There is something more fundamental at stake: the sort of country we are. A democracy where disagreements do not degenerate into incivility and where debate is not used to divide our communities.'We have a chance as a country to reject division, isolationism and blame. To choose co-operation.

Vote Leave to take control of your family's destiny, Boris tells women: Former London mayor says 'out of control' immigration is depriving families of access to schools, homes and healthcare2016-6-19Boris Johnson today warns the ‘out of control’ immigration system is depriving families of certainty over access to school places, housing and healthcare.In a direct appeal to women voters, he says the only way for families to be in control of their own destiny is to vote to leave the EU on Thursday.Mr Johnson yesterday insisted he was a huge supporter of immigration – and even suggested there should be an amnesty for illegal workers who have been in the UK for 12 years or more.Boris Johnson today warns the ‘out of control’ immigration system is depriving families of certainty over access to school places, housing and healthcareBut in an exclusive Daily Mail interview, he said uncontrolled EU immigration was preventing the public sector from properly planning to ensure there are enough schools, GP surgeries and homes.He warned that – in turn – this is depriving families of the ability to plan for the future of their children.Mr Johnson said: ‘It is about control. It is about security, safety of your country and your economy and being in charge.‘You want to be able to manage your household yourself, you want to be able to manage how things work pretty exactly.‘If we take back control of immigration we can help local authorities plan for vital services. That will mean that young people will have a better chance of getting on the housing ladder and there will be less pressure on school places or the NHS. At the moment the system is out of control and no one can plan effectively.’In an exclusive Daily Mail interview, Mr Johnson said uncontrolled EU immigration was preventing the public sector from properly planning to ensure there are enough schools, GP surgeries and homesHe added: ‘It will take time – but if you have an immigration system that is based on the needs of the economy rather than just a doctrine and ideology of free movement, I think you get to plan better.‘You’re thinking about your kids and whether they are going to be able to afford a home. That is of great importance. Whether your kids can be part of an economy that is outward-looking and mobilised – able to do deals with growth economies not locked into the EU.‘I’d be thinking where is Britain going – what is it going to be like for us in 20 or 30 years’ time. Are we going to be part of this very closed system or are we going to take back control and really set our priorities?’Mr Johnson dismissed the doom-mongering of David Cameron and the Remain camp, saying: ‘I have seen no evidence of an economic shock.’ He went on: ‘The only way to end this tidal wave of gloom from the Government is to vote Leave.‘I think the negativity is very intense and I do not think it is doing anybody’s mood much good. If I were them I would not have fought the campaign this way.’At a rally in London yesterday, Mr Johnson said the way to ‘neutralise’ extremist views in Britain was for the country to regain control of its borders. He said those who ‘play politics’ with immigration would be silenced if the UK was able to take charge of a ‘completely out of control’ system.The former London mayor also repeated previous calls for an amnesty on illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years.He said: ‘If we take back control of our immigration system with an Australian-style points-based system, we’ll be dealing fairly and justly with every part of the world and we will be neutralising people in this country and across Europe who wish to play politics with immigration and who are opposed to immigrants. That is the way forward.’He asked Leave supporters to imagine waking up on Friday morning to face the ‘terrible sense of shock and disappointment that Remain have narrowly won’.Mr Johnson said the TV cameras would turn to ‘[European Commission president] Jean-Claude Juncker celebrating with what looks suspiciously like champagne, and then go to Peter Mandelson and the rest saying the way is now clear for Britain to join the euro’.He added: ‘We will have missed a fantastic opportunity for change and improvement for Europe and this country ... We cannot vote for a status quo, with the EU morphing relentlessly into a superstate, with activist judges making decisions including who can be on our streets whether they are terror suspects and convicted criminals or not.’Attacking the Remain side, he added: ‘They endlessly say we can’t do it, we daren’t do it, we mustn’t do it – and we say that we can.’'Ignore Obama's threats'A group of powerful US Congressmen yesterday said Britain will be at the ‘front’ of the line for a trade deal in the event of Brexit.The 11 politicians demolish a central plank of the case that Britain will not be able to trade freely with the world outside the EU.In a letter to President Obama, they also attack him for his ‘misguided effort’ to try to bully Britain into a vote to remain.In a letter to President Obama, pictured, a group of powerful Congressmen have attacked him for his ‘misguided effort’ to try to bully Britain into a vote to remainIn April, Mr Obama made the extraordinary threat that we would be at the ‘back of the queue’ for a trade deal – even though his presidency is nearly over.The signatories to the letter include Devin Nunes and Pat Tiberi, two former chairmen of Congress’s Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.Their letter states that while a Brexit vote ‘may open new opportunities for cooperation with our British friends’, it ‘will not diminish any of our vital ties’ . It adds: ‘For us, Britain stands at the front of the line.’Polls say it's too close to callThe EU referendum looked too close to call last night as two polls showed a late swing back to the Remain camp.The polls based on the latest surveys of voters – which were conducted almost entirely after the killing on Thursday of Labour MP Jo Cox – both put the In side in the lead.It reverses a rise in support for Leave, with seven out of nine surveys released before the murder putting the pro-Brexit camp ahead.A Survation telephone poll for The Mail on Sunday, conducted on Friday and Saturday, put Remain on 45 per cent, with Leave on 42 per cent. Survation’s previous poll, published on Thursday, had shown Out ahead of In by the same margin. A YouGov online poll for The Sunday Times, conducted on Thursday and Friday, showed a 44-43 per cent lead for In. It reversed a lead of seven points for Out in a YouGov survey last Monday.But an online poll by Opinium for The Observer showed Leave drawing level with Remain on 44 per cent each. Interviews took place between Tuesday and Friday. An Opinium/Observer poll, published on June 11, showed In ahead of Out by 44-42 per cent.Cameron 'misled MPs and voters over his EU deal' David Cameron alongside David Dimbleby during a BBC Question Time event in Milton Keynes last nightDavid Cameron has been accused of misleading MPs and the public after claiming he had ‘secured vital treaty changes’ in his negotiations with the European Union.The Prime Minister made the claim in the Commons this month despite the fact that his ‘deal’ has not involved any changes to EU treaties.Veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash demanded he withdraw the claim, saying that under Commons rules, ministers must resign if they mislead MPs.Sir Bill said: ‘Voters are being told we secured “vital treaty changes”, but when they cast their vote [in the referendum] there is no guarantee whatsoever that any such treaty changes will happen.’In a letter to the Mr Cameron, he wrote: ‘I do not know whether this was inadvertent or not, but either way it requires correction. To do otherwise would be to mislead the Commons and the country.’The House of Commons Library found Mr Cameron’s deal was ‘not a binding EU treaty or EU law’. And the European Scrutiny Committee, chaired by Sir Bill, found the deal ‘does not and cannot change the [EU] treaty’.However, Mr Cameron told Sir Bill his deal includes a ‘binding and irreversible commitment that the EU member states will at the next opportunity amend the EU treaties to address key UK concerns’.Bosses attack EU 'straitjacket'Britain must quit the ‘energy-sapping’ EU and free firms from Brussels control, a group of entrepreneurs said last night.The 37 small business owners said their companies would thrive once freed from the EU ‘straitjacket’.The signatories to the letter are led by Luke Johnson, who has made Pizza Express and Patisserie Valerie into nationwide successes.All 37 entrepreneurs have become major market players after turning an original idea or a small family firm into top wealth-creators.In the letter to the Sun on Sunday, they say: ‘This was achieved in spite of the EU, not because of it.’Lined up with Mr Johnson for Brexit are Superdrug founder Peter Goldstein, Toby Baxendale of Direct Seafoods and James Tanner of Tanners Wine.John Mills of retail promotions firm JML and Stuart Wheeler of finance company IG have also thrown their weight behind him.Brexiter, 80, held over 'Out' graffitiAn 80-year-old Brexit campaigner revealed yesterday that he had been arrested after being caught painting ‘Vote Leave’ in 2ft-high letters around his home town.Veteran former councillor John Kapp said he had been arrested for the first time in his life after police caught him daubing the ‘Out’ message in white paint on eight billboards by the side of a road.Officers who arrested him on suspicion of causing criminal damage have released him on bail while they investigate his actions, on condition that he does not leave home carrying a brush or pot of paint.The lifelong Conservative supporter, from Hove, East Sussex, said: ‘I’ve had a Vote Leave sticker in my window for weeks now but hardly anyone goes down the road where I live, so I thought I’d choose the A259 where lots of people will see it.’ He went on to say he was ‘disgusted’ by tactics used by the Remain campaign.

Thanks to all of you. #IndependenceDay'He looked jubilant after the vote, despite the fact that it could mean the end of his political career after 25 years of campaigning as he would lose his job as an MEP and does not have a Westminster seat.However, he said today that the next step for Britain is a 'pro-Brexit' Prime Minister and after the vote, David Cameron announced he will stand aside in October.After losing the campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, Cameron could now face a snap election which may leave the door open for Farage to finally win a seat in the Commons. After the result was confirmed this morning, he said: 'Today, the sun has risen on an independent Britain, and look at it, even the weather has improved.'He said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning that the next step is choosing the right leader, and suggested June 23 - 'independence day' - should be made a public holiday.  Late last night, the Ukip leader looked crestfallen as he publicly admitted defeat when the exit polls gave Remain a slim lead.However, by 12.30am, he looked jubilant as Sunderland returned with a big victory for Leave that experts had previously predicted would indicate they would go on to win the vote.At 4.30am, he claimed an overall win, throwing his hands in the air as he declared June 23 Britain's 'independence day'. Talking of the victory today, he added: 'The election was won in my view in the Midlands and the North and it was the old Labour vote that came to us and we, particularly as a party, campaigned as hard as we could in those areas,' he told reporters on College Green in Westminster.'There is still a massive disconnect between Westminster, SW1 and real communities,' he added.Farage also said he hoped Brexit would kick start the break up of the EU.Nigel Farage responds to a historic victory today, although it could mean the end of his career in politicsAfter the result was confirmed, Farage spoke on the steps of Westminster, saying: 'Today, the sun has risen on an independent Britain, and look at it, even the weather has improved.'As he accepted congratulations from fellow campaigners, the Ukip leader smiled outside WestminsterHe added: 'An opinion poll in the Netherlands said that a majority there now want to leave, so we may well be close perhaps to Nexit.'Similarly in Denmark a majority there are in favour of leaving so we could be quite close to Dexit.'And I'm told the same may apply to Sweden and perhaps Austria and perhaps even Italy too.'The EU is failing, the EU is dying, I hope that we've got the first brick out of the wall.'He added: 'We need the negotiations to start as soon as humanly possible, we need to start thinking globally about our future, and the other thing I think that needs to happen is that June 23 needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it independence day.'Nigel Farage was a founding member of Ukip after leaving the Conservative party in 1992 and campaigning against the euro and European Union. The scenes outside Westminster were awash with Union Jacks today after A vote leave supporter celebrates at a Brexit party in Westminster after early votes suggest a victoryHe fought for seats in Westminster elections and the European union elections in 1994, billing himself as an alternative to mainstream politicians, but did not win a seat for Ukip.Farage was eventually elected as a Member of the European Parliament in 1999 and gave controversial speeches against the euro, constantly criticising the work of Brussels.He continued to fight for change and became leader of the Ukip party in 2006, however, he has been unable to win a seat in Westminster despite contesting numerous elections.In the 2010 election, he fought for the seat of Buckingham and Westminster, briefly resigning from his post as leader of Ukip to focus on the election.He was seriously injured in a plane crash when the aircraft, which was flying a Ukip banner, came down on the morning of the election on May 6.Farage suffered a punctured lung and broken injuries and said he has lived with constant pain due to the injuries. Farage said today that the first thing that needs to happen in Britain is for a pro-Brexit Prime Minister to replace David Cameron, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the EUThis morning, Cameron announced he will be resigning in October, saying he is not the right person to 'captain the ship' as Britain departs from the European UnionHe failed to win the seat, however, he claimed a win for the party when the Conservatives promised an EU referendum to stave off an increasing wave of Euroscepticism within the public and their own party.Farage fought for another seat, Thanet South, in 2010, and had promised to resign if he did not win.However, after handing in his resignation to the Ukip board, they refused it in a controversial move which saw him hold on to leadership of the party.But despite failing to win a seat, Farage claimed a victory today in the historic ballot after stacking up votes in England and Wales against support for Remain in London and Scotland. The direction of the battle started to become

signposted a disastrous showing for Remain across Wales.Nigel Farage shakes his supporters' hands after a dramatic speech claiming victory in which he credited ordinary volunteers from all and no political parties with the Leave winA jubilant Nigel Farage celebrated with supporters after the Leave campaign headed for a victory with just a few areas left to declareBut now the battle is won, Conservative MPs such as Leave campaign leaders Boris Johnson and Michael Gove will be expected to usher in the change with Farage stuck in the political wilderness.Even if Farage were to win a by-election, there are questions over his health after speculation when he was fighting the election last year.He admitted he was prescribed Temazepam for a serious back condition and suffered serious headaches and shoulder pain.The politician said he saw his doctor twice a week for treatment and he had also been prescribed with sleeping pills to help as he worked to a grueling schedule throughout the election campaign.He has also been touched by scandal after being accused of having an affair with former aide Annabelle Fuller. But today, he enjoyed the victory, speaking on the steps of Westminster after celebrating with campaigners in London. The Ukip leader, who started campaigning for Brexit 25 years ago, raised his hands in delight after Leave won the vote last nightMoments after all the results were declared, he thanked the British people, tweeting: 'We've got our country back. Thanks to all of you. #IndependenceDay.' This morning, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that Britain must 'have a Government that is committed to Brexit',He added: 'Two things need to happen - one is a Brexit Prime Minister, and secondly we need a negotiating team who are going to go to Brussels to get us our new deal.'But also, simultaneously, let's start negotiating not just with Brussels but with the rest of the world because the real opportunity we have got from Brexit is that we have left a failing political union in Europe, we can now start to re-engage with the world.'He said he was prepared to wait a couple of months to get a pro-Brexit Prime Minister and that Britain should 'play within the rules of the club' and trigger Article 50 and begin the process of leaving the EU.Calling for a national holiday, he added: 'There are 183 countries in the world who have independence day - what we have just done is we voted to become the 184th.Leave campaigners cheer from London as they welcome winning results around the country tonightUKIP's Paul Nuttall, Steven Woolfe and David Campbell at Manchester Town Hall celebrating the victory'We have broken free from a failing political union. We have managed, the little people, the ordinary people who have ignored all the threats that have come from big business and big politics and it has been a huge, amazing exercise in democracy.'Speaking at the national count centre in Manchester, Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of Ukip, said: 'This is just the beginning - we are going to make this country even better.'When asked about the impact on Sterling, he replied: 'That's short term pain for long term gain.'David Cameron will face crowds outside Downing Street today, where he is expected to announce that Britain will be leaving the EU.Yesterday, 80 pro-Brexit Conservative MPs signed a letter backing him to stay on as Prime Minister even if Britain votes to Leave but he will now face pressure to resign after a failed campaign to Remain.The SNP said the result could now trigger a new referendum in Scotland, which voted heavily in favour of remaining in the EU. 

Who will be NEXIT? The Swexits, Czexits and Frexits that could follow Britain out of the EU... and the aftershocks hitting continent2016-6-24Eurosceptic parties across the continent are intensifying demands for their own referendums in the wake of the Brexit vote, as the repercussions of the political earthquake gradually become clear.Shortly after the result was announced, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National in France, called for a 'Frexit' vote on Twitter, while the far-Right Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders called for a 'Nexit'. In Italy the leader of the Italian anti-immigrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, called the European Union 'a cage of crazies' that is killing jobs and citizen dignity. And there are also fears that Brexit could also trigger a Czexit, a Swexit, and a Grexit in the Czech Republic, Sweden and Greece. Even if the union holds, the political earthquake that has erupted in Britain will have far-reaching aftershocks.Grexit next? A survey by the Pew Research Center suggested that Greece and France are close behind Britain on opposition to the EUAll over Europe, countries are experiencing a surge in Euroscepticism that will only be emboldened by Brexit. A recent poll suggested that 36 per cent of Swedes would be in favour of 'Swexit' if Britain were to leave. In May, an Ipsos Mori poll revealed that more than half of French and Italian citizens want a referendum, and the same number believed there would be a 'domino effect' if Britain were to leave.'All over Europe people are worried about the crises we face such as migration and terrorism,' Jeppe Kofod, a Danish MEP and leader of the Social Democrats in the European Parliament, told MailOnline.'Now that the UK has left, many are starting to think that this would be the solution for them.'With the European authorities scrambling to formulate a response to the UK's earthquake decision, here is MailOnline's analysis of how Brexit contagion may affect key countries within the EU: A survey by the Pew Research Center suggested that Poland is the most enthusiastic member of the EU When the Brexit results were announced, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National pictured above today,, tweeted simply 'victory for freedom'Margot Wallstrom, Sweden's Foreign Minister, said she was concerned that Brexit would mean the collapse of the EU. 'That might affect other EU member states that will say, well, if they can leave, maybe we should also have referendums, and maybe we should also leave'DENMARK There has been a long bond between Britain and Denmark, with it openly supporting David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate Britain's deal with the EU.Like Britain, Denmark benefits from a number of exceptions from EU rules.The far-Right Danish People's Party (DPP) has called for the country to hold a referendum of its own following the Brexit vote. Kristian Thulesen Dahls, the leader, has demanded reforms to the EU followed by a vote on membership.The DPP is not opposed to the EU on principle, but wants to limit the reach of the EU, preventing it from getting involved too closely with the affairs of member states.It holds 37 seats out of 179 in the parliament, making it the second-largest party in the country.The close relationship between Denmark, Sweden and the UK raises the likelihood that Brexit will be followed by referendums in those two countries.Dexit? Danish prime minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen speaks to media after Britain's voted to leave the European Union while Social Democrat Mette Frederiksen has said the EU is in a deep 'crisis of legitimacy'Danish prime minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen (R) and Danish foreign minister Kristian Jensen speak to media after Britain's voted to leave the European UnionSWEDEN Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Swedes wish to stay in the EU - yet when you considering a Europe without Britain, the results are radically different.One recent poll by TNS Sifo suggested that 36 per cent of Swedes would vote to leave the EU if the UK opted for Brexit, with only 32 per cent wishing to remain.The Nordic country has traditionally been one of Britain's closest EU allies, often voting the same way as the UK in the European Parliament and opting to stay out of the Euro.Margot Wallstrom, Sweden's Foreign Minister, said she was concerned that Brexit would mean the collapse of the EU.'That might affect other EU member states that will say, well, if they can leave, maybe we should also have referendums, and maybe we should also leave,' she told the BBC.The rapid influx of large numbers of migrants into Sweden in particular has also prompted a resurgence of the far-Right in the country, further inflaming the EU debate.She then wasted no time in calling for a French referendum modelled on the British vote, saying 'I would vote for Brexit, even if I think that France has 1,000 more reasons to leave than the UK'Far-Right leader Marine Le Pen tweeted today and is now calling for a French poll that models Britain's referendumFRANCE  When the Brexit results were announced, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National, tweeted simply 'victory for freedom'. She then wasted no time in calling for a French referendum modelled on the British vote.'I would vote for Brexit, even if I think that France has 1,000 more reasons to leave than the UK,' she said, referring to the EU as 'decaying'.Ms Le Pen has previously called for all member states to hold their own referendums.Presidential elections are due in France in 2017, and Ms Le Pen is one of the leading candidates – though polls have suggested that she may not win.She has consistently argued that the EU is bad for French jobs, and blames it for supposedly allowing criminals to enter the country.Her insistence on placing the EU on her agenda, together with her growing popularity, raises the likelihood of a Frexit referendum in the years to come.However, recent polls have placed the number of French citizens who would vote to leave the EU at 41 per cent.Under pressure: European president Martin Schultz looked under pressure today following the Brexit vote as European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, right, also appeared to feel the heatBeppe Grillo, leader of the populist Five Star movement, said: 'The mere fact that a country like Great Britain is holding a referendum on whether to leave the EU signals the failure of the EU'ITALY  Polls have revealed that 48 per cent of Italians believe they would be better off out of the EU, and would vote to leave given the opportunity.That figure has increased from 35 per cent over the last year, suggesting that Eurosceptic momentum is building under the weight of Italy's migration crisis, poor economic performance and youth joblessness.Earlier this month, the populist Five Star movement vowed it would demand a referendum on the Euro, which would lead to a full-scale vote on EU membership.This is the latest move in a long-term campaign to put the question of remaining in the Eurozone to the Italian people, as the movement believes that Europe should have two currencies, one for the wealthy northern counties and another for the poorer countries in the south.The party is growing in popularity. Earlier this month, it won 19 out of 20 mayoral elections in the country, a major headache for prime minister Matteo Renzi.Beppe Grillo, the party's leader, said: 'The mere fact that a country like Great Britain is holding a referendum on whether to leave the EU signals the failure of the EU.'As one of the core members of the EU, an Italian referendum would be extremely damaging to the EU's integrity.Meanwhile the leader of the Italian anti-immigrant Northern League  called the European Union 'a cage of crazies' that is killing jobs and citizen dignity.Matteo Salvini, who heads the right-wing party, said today that the European Union is 'the death of our work, our dignity.'He says his party will push for reviewing and overhauling EU treaties dealing with the euro common currency, trade and immigration.The League used to be a key ally of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi. But it has increasingly become more right-wing as it seeks alliances with far-right parties across Europe.A Dutch general election looms in March, and some polls have Geert Wilders, the idiosyncratic, far-Right politician, pictured above, as the favourite. Today he called for a referendum for the DutchToday's tweet from the far-Right politician Geert Wilders, who is demanding a referendum for the Netherlands Following the Brexit vote, Wilder's tweeted, 'hurrah for the Brits!

Now it's our turn. time for a Dutch referendum!'For a long time, giving the Dutch a say on Europe has been high on his agenda. 'As quickly as possible, the Dutch people need the opportunity to have their say about Dutch membership of the EU,' he has said. 'If I become prime minister there will be a referendum in the Netherlands… Let the Dutch people decide.'Latest polls have shown that 54 per cent of Dutch voters are in favour of a referendum on EU membership, making it likely in the next few years.Austria's new chancellor, Christian Kern, pictured today, has said that Brexit could mean the 'slow goodbye of the European idea' unless serious reform is carried outAustria's new chancellor has said: 'Whatever the outcome of the British referendum, afterwards Europe will not be able to shy away for a few much-needed debates' AUSTRIAThis month, Austria's new chancellor, Christian Kern, said that Brexit could mean the 'slow goodbye of the European idea' unless serious reform is carried out.'Whatever the outcome of the British referendum, afterwards Europe will not be able to shy away for a few much-needed debates,' he said, adding that Brexit would trigger 'enormous economic upheaval and a shift in the continent's political balance'.Austria has a large Eurosceptic movement, as was demonstrated when Norbert Hofer, the far-Right populist candidate, came within a hair's breadth of winning the presidency. His party, the FPÖ, has experienced a surge in support in recent months.CZECH REPUBLICThe Czech prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka, has warned that a Brexit could trigger a 'Czexit'.'The consequences could really be tremendous,' he told a Czech news agency in May. 'Debates about leaving the EU could be expected if this country in a few years, too, if Britain left the EU.'Parties like the Civic Democratic Party or the Czech Communist Party could gain momentum in the aftermath of Brexit, he said, leading to a return to 'the Russian sphere of influence, which is against our national interests'.Last year, a poll found that 62 per cent of Czechs would vote to leave the EU in a referendum, amid anger after Brussels forced the country to accept a number of migrants.Troubled: Greece is still in desperate financial straits and economists have predicted that the struggling nation could exit the Eurozone altogether now that the UK has voted BrexitA sign on Kos in Greece today suggested a financial crisis had already been triggered by the Brexit vote, with Britons on holiday finding themselves unable to withdraw money GREECEEconomists have predicted that Greece could exit the Eurozone altogether now that the UK has voted Brexit. The economic uncertainty produced by Britain leaving the EU has the potential to seriously destabilise the Greek economy as it continues to struggle under the weight of long-term structural reforms and debt repayments, the Economist Intelligence Unit said.The Mediterranean country is one of the most Eurosceptic countries in the EU, with polls revealing that 50 per cent of Greeks believe that the EU has not benefitted their nation.It has a range of Eurosceptic political parties, including the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn and the far-Right ANEL, which are likely to agitate for a referendum in the wake of Brexit.SPAINPro-EU feeling dominates in Spain. Despite soaring unemployment, a stalled economy and political disenfranchisement, Spanish woes have not yet given rise to a Eurosceptic party.Spain was able to join the European Community in 1975 after the death of dictator General Franco, by which time they were desperate to join. Some have suggested that it is this sense of relief that continues to inform Spanish Europhilia.There are more than 760,000 Britons living in Spain. The Prime Minister was careful to reassure ex-patriots that they would not be deported overnight, but many are concerned that they will no longer enjoy the same rights as they did as EU citizens, for example in accessing public healthcare.Brexit is seen as wholly bad for Poland, and there was huge shock amongst Poles as the implications of Brexit sink, with migrants who were flying back on a break from Britain in the airport, above, expressing great concernNow that Britain will leave the EU, Poles may have to face the process of applying for work visas, and many may be rejectedPOLANDBrexit is seen as wholly bad for Poland, and there is huge shock amongst Poles as the implications of Brexit sink in. When Poland joined the EU in 2004, hundreds of thousands of its citizens went to live and work in Europe, 850,000 of them in the UK.Now that Britain will leave the EU, Poles may have to face the process of applying for work visas, and many may be rejected.Moreover, the volatility of the financial markets fuelled by Brexit has affected Poland badly. The zloty plummeted in value in its steepest dive since 2011, losing 3.8 per cent against the Euro as the market worried that trade between Britain and Poland would become more difficult.The removal of the EU's second-largest economy from the bloc will mean less money to go round, probably meaning that Poland will get fewer handouts to construct infrastructure an roads.Up to 300,000 Hungarians live and work in Britain, and Brexit has caused them immediate anxiety about their future living and working arrangements. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, pictured in the stands at the Euro Championship this week, took out full page newspaper adverts to try to convince Britain to stay HUNGARYUp to 300,000 Hungarians live and work in Britain, and Brexit has caused them immediate anxiety about their future living and working arrangements.With this in mind, earlier this month, the Hungarian government took out a full-page advertisement in the Daily Mail urging readers to vote Remain.At the same time, Hungary is one of the most Eurosceptic countries in Europe. Its parliament contains a majority of anti-EU parties, including the neo-Nazi party Jobbik.Relations between Hungary and Brussels have been strained, particularly over the migration crisis, with Hungary refusing to comply with Germany's demands and take a quota of refugees.Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister, has announced a referendum in September or October on whether to accept refugees.The migrant question has become probably the single most fractious issue in the relationship between Hungarians and the EU, and Brexit is likely to exacerbate these frustrations.As Britain's closest neighbour, pro-Europe Ireland will inevitably be caught up in the economic turmoil that will dominate at least in the short term after Brexit. Vice President Joe Biden, right, embraces Taoiseach Enda Kenny, left, following their bilateral meeting at the government building this weekOne of the most pressing issues facing Irish leader Enda Kenny, pictured right above with Joe Biden, will be the question of border controls between the Republic of Ireland and Northern IrelandIRELANDAs Britain's closest neighbour, pro-Europe Ireland will inevitably be caught up in the economic turmoil that will dominate at least in the short term after Brexit.New trade arrangements will need to be drawn up to allow Britain and Ireland to continue their close commercial cooperation.But the foremost issue that demands consideration is the question of border controls.The 310mile land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will likely need to be policed when Britain leaves the EU, but the extent to which this will be enforced is far from clear.This has serious implications for the Northern Ireland peace process, at the heart of which was the gradual easing of the border between the two territories - but also potentially for migration.The Brexit vote will place fresh emphasis on the need of border controls, risking inflaming old rivalries and setting the peace process back. 

Nigel Farage dismisses fury over his pro-Brexit immigration poster and claims it only sparked such a row because Labour MP Jo Cox was KILLED2016-6-19Nigel Farage today insisted there would not have been such a 'row' over Ukip's controversial pro-Brexit immigration poster if Jo Cox had not been brutally killed.The Ukip leader complained he was the 'victim' of hatred and insisted the party would be putting out more material focusing on the key issue of control over our borders.The defence came as politicians from all sides in the EU referendum battle lined up to slam the 'racist' poster. Mr Farage unveiled the image - which featured the headline 'Breaking Point' over a photograph of refugees walking into Europe through Slovenia - on Thursday just hours before Labour MP Jo Cox was shot dead and the referendum battle was suspended.Michael Gove today revealed he 'shuddered' when Ukip unveiled an anti-immigration poster featuring refugees just a week before the EU referendum.The Justice Secretary said the poster, branded racist by critics, was the 'wrong thing to do'. Chancellor George Osborne, who supports the Remain campaign, also condemned the poster today as having 'echoes' of far right literature from the 1930s. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and Brexit-backing Labour MP John Mann all slammed the poster in interviews today.  Michael Gove today told the BBC's Andrew Marr that he 'shuddered' when he saw the Ukip poster on immigration when it was unveiled last week  Nigel Farage unveiled the controversial poster on Thursday, exactly a week before the EU referendum but was immediately condemned for the tone Mr Gove said: 'When I saw that poster, I shuddered. I felt it was the wrong thing to do.'I must stress, I believe in free speech, I don't want to deny anyone a platform, and when I have had the opportunity to talk about migration during the course of this debate.'I hope I have been very clear I am pro-migration but the way in which we secure public support for the continued benefits migration brings, the way we secure public support for helping refugees in need is if people feel they can control the numbers overall coming here.'Chancellor George Osborne, who supports the Remain camaign, also condemned the poster today as having 'echoes' of far right literature from the 1930s.Mr Osborne told ITV's Peston on Sunday: 'I think there is a difference between addressing those concerns [about immigration] in a reasonable way and whipping up concerns, whipping up division, making baseless assertions that millions of people are going to come into the country in the next couple of years from Turkey, or saying that dead bodies are going to wash up on the beaches of Kent – or, indeed, putting up that disgusting and vile poster that Nigel Farage did which had echoes of literature used in the 1930s.'That is what we should say no to and this referendum vote is a vote on the kind of Britain we want.'Mr Farage today rejected the charge of stoking up hatred, telling ITV interviewer Robert Peston: 'I think I have been a politician who has been a victim of it, to be honest with you.'When you challenge the establishment in this country, they come after you, they call you all sorts of things. We saw the Chancellor a few minutes ago - despite the fact that overnight he talked about turning down the rhetoric - doing the same thing again.'Despite his criticism of the Ukip poster, Mr Gove defended the official Vote Leave campaign's claims about immigration and particularly the possibility of Turkey joining the EU Asked if he wished he hadn't unveiled the poster, Mr Farage replied: 'I wish an innocent Member of Parliament hadn't been gunned down on the street.'That's the point, and frankly had that not happened, I don't think we would have had the kind of row that we've had over it.'He added: 'There was a big momentum developing right across the country, [then] a tragic death... It's difficult to see where either of the campaigns go.'Mr Farage said: 'That poster reflects the truth of what's going on. We have a new poster coming out tomorrow morning and we'll unveil a new poster for every day.'Mr Gove defended the claims on immigration made by his own campaign about Turkey, insisting it was not wrong to ensure migrant numbers are controlled.Interviewed by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Gove was challenged on Vote Leave leaflets which claim Turkey's high birth rate would mean a million more people having the right to come to Britain.Mr Gove said: 'I think it is important to stress that when we are thinking about the enlargement of the European Union - and it is the official policy of the EU to accelerate Turkey's accession.'I think the fact that both the British government and the EU want Turkey and other countries to join is clear. The rate and speed at which Turkey will join will depend on a variety of political factors.'But it is the case that during the course of this year the EU want to accelerate that process and I think that when Turkey is becoming less democratic that is not the right thing to do.'Mr Gove denied discussion of Turkey's birth rate made him 'queasy' and added: 'I think it is very important when we are talking about migration to take into account numbers overall as well.'One of the things about numbers is that we benefit from migration if the numbers are controlled.' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today admitted he did not believe there could be limits placed on free movement in the EU as he claimed the Government was at fault for not giving communities resources to cope Scottish first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today renewed her criticism of the Ukip poster.She told Sky News: 'In these last few days I hope we can have a debate that doesn't focus on immigration.'Yes, people's concerns about immigration need to be addressed, but let's also make the positive case for a world and a Europe where we all have the freedom of travel and the positive case for immigration and the benefits that brings to our economy.'On that point, the poster that Nigel Farage unveiled last week was vile and racist and I hope he does agree today to withdraw that poster, because that kind of sentiment has no place in a civilised debate.'Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was asked directly whether he thought there should be an upper limit on the numbers coming to the UK.Chancellor George Osborne today said the Ukip poster had 'echoes' of 1930s literature  Mr Corbyn said: 'I don't think you can have one while you have the free movement of labour, and the free movement of labour means that you have to balance the economy.'So you have to improve living standards and conditions and so that means the EU's appalling treatment of Greece is a problem.'If you deliberately lower living standards and increase poverty in south eastern Europe, then you're bound to have a flow of people looking for somewhere to go.'Surely the issue is an anti-austerity, growth package all across Europe rather than this.'Defending his poster amid attacks from all sides of the political spectrum, Mr Farage claimed 'all' the people pictured in the poster will have EU passports within years.'This is a statement about the whole of the European Union and politically I really do think that the European Union is at breaking point,' he told the BBC as he unveiled the poster in Westminster. Mr Farage today told ITV Vote Leave should answer for their own posters.He said: 'Well, have you seen their posters? They've been doing very strong posters, not only about Turkey, but about the number of terrorists and criminals who come into Britain under free movement rules.'

The last picture of tragic Jo Cox: Murdered MP is seen giving lecture to schoolchildren in her Yorkshire constituency in photo tweeted less than 24 hours before she was shot dead 2016-6-17Tweeted by MP Jo Cox less than 24 hours before she was killed in the street, this is the last picture of her - speaking to students in her constituency about the EU referendum.The 41-year-old married politician, who was shot and stabbed yesterday outside her constituency advice surgery, spoke at Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, last Friday.Remain campaigner Mrs Cox tweeted a photo shortly before 4pm on Wednesday of her visit to speak to students ahead of next Thursday’s referendum, saying there was 'lots of interest and great questions'.Scroll down for videoFinal picture: On Wednesday afternoon, Remain campaigner Jo Cox MP tweeted a photo of her visit to Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, to tell students about next week's EU referendumPositive visit: Mrs Cox said there was 'lots of interest and great questions' at Whitcliffe Mount School (above)A group of teenagers could be seen in a library as Mrs Cox spoke in front of a screen saying: 'What are immigrants and migrants? What's the difference?' She said they had an 'excellent' debate.But only 21 hours after posting the tweet she was attacked in Birstall by a man alleged to have shouted ‘Britain first’, three months after another man was cautioned for sending her ‘malicious communications’.A school spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘The entire school community at Whitcliffe Mount are deeply shocked and saddened at the devastating loss of our wonderful MP and friend, Jo Cox.‘In an all too brief career as MP Jo made a huge impact. As a regular visitor to Whitcliffe Mount, she was an inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to meet her.‘Students and staff alike looked forward to her visits and a buzz would always spread throughout the school in anticipation. Many of our students have come to know Jo well and benefitted enormously from her vast experience.‘As a proud “Yorkshire lass” and the first member of her family to go to university, Jo was determined to raise the aspirations of local youngsters and to instil in them a belief that there is no limit to what they can achieve.’ A week before her death: Labour MP Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed yesterday outside her constituency advice surgery in Birstall, Leeds, led an assembly at Batley Parish School in West Yorkshire last ThursdayVisit: Schoolchildren at Batley Parish School listened intently as she spoke about democracy and aspirationEgoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allBye Felicia!

Jo always listened and genuinely wanted to make a difference in people’s lives.’ The photo has since been retweeted more than 1,000 times, and was reposted by Mrs Cox’s fellow Yorkshire Labour MP Caroline Flint, who said Britain had lost a ‘good MP and loving mum’.Responding to the photo, Twitter user Debs Woodhall-James from York said: ‘Hopefully Jo's beliefs and her inspirational talk will have impacted on these children to challenge for change.’ Appearance: Also on Tuesday, Mrs Cox posted a photo of her visit to Heckmondwike's Yorkshire Chippy with its manager Tracy Smylie (left), 18-year-old frier Paige Ramsden (centre) and server Lindsay Broadley (right)Working with the community: Mrs Cox tweeted another picture of her on Tuesday afternoon, saying: 'Pleased to support Bringing Batley and Spen Together, for professionals and groups working hard for local people'Others said she was a 'politician you didn't hear anything bad about' and a 'good constituency MP', while another said there were ‘not enough words to express how truly awful this is’.Later on Tuesday, Mrs Cox posted a photo of her visit to Heckmondwike's Yorkshire Chippy, which claims to be Britain's first gluten-free-only fish and chip shop, and described their food as ‘delicious’.Jad Choudhury, 31, founder and director of the shop, told MailOnline today that Mrs Cox had popped in last Thursday in what is believed to be her last visit to a business. Mr Choudhury said: ‘She came down because she's been part of the business from the planning - she really wanted to put Heckmondwike on the map.‘We're the first ever gluten-free fish and chip shop in history. Before I even started the business I got in touch with her. She's really keen to support the business. We’ve only been going since March.‘She came down last week to try our fish and chips. She was supposed to come back to us this week with her family to have fish and chips with her family.

Many of our students have come to know Jo well and benefited enormously from her vast experience.‘As a proud “Yorkshire lass” and the first member of her family to go to university, Jo was determined to raise the aspirations of local youngsters and to instil in them a belief that there is no limit to what they can achieve.’‘Whether debating with Citizenship students, showing sociology students round Parliament or simply enjoying a chat over tea and cake at a coffee morning, all who met Jo were struck by her warmth, her caring nature and her passion.‘Those qualities very quickly earned her the respect and admiration of us all and established her as an inspiration to so many of our students.‘At this time of grief and sadness it is also right that we celebrate the enormous impact Jo made and the joy she brought to so many.‘This morning, the whole school community stopped to reflect on the many happy memories we share of a warm, caring, generous woman who inspired us all to aim for the stars, hold firm to our beliefs and be compassionate to those less fortunate than ourselves.’

'I’m shocked and fearful': Brexit forces British expats to become FRENCH because they are so scared of being sent home2016-6-24Two days before the Brexit vote, Nick and Allison Feeley, went to their local sous-prefecture to begin the process of taking French nationality.Although convinced the UK would remain within the EU after the vote, they decided they’d better start to cover their backs. Just in case of a worse case scenario.Now, in two months, after a language and knowledge test and an in-depth interview, they will, if all goes well, become citizens of the Republic of France.It is not a move either of them foresaw, or necessarily wished for, when they left an increasingly stressful, difficult life in England to seek the good life, or dream, in La France Profonde amid the sunflower fields of the Tarn et Garonne.Did not, in all their calculations, factor in a Brexit.‘Now we see no other way to keep our life here,’ says Allison simply.Two days before the Brexit vote, Nick and Allison Feeley, pictured outside their gites complex with daughters Megan, now 23, and Abigail, 14, went to their local sous-prefecture to begin the process of taking French nationalityNow, in two months, after a language and knowledge test and an in-depth interview, they will, if all goes well, become citizens of the Republic of FranceIn many ways we are already French citizens – we pay our taxes here, are domiciled here, our daughter is more French than English, and we’ve worked day and night for all we’ve got‘But we intend to go for dual nationality. We could never cut off our links with Britain and God knows what the future holds for us in France.‘But our lives are firmly here.‘In many ways we are already French citizens – we pay our taxes here, are domiciled here, our daughter is more French than English, and we’ve worked day and night for all we’ve got.‘We cannot see that taken away.’Still shocked and they admit, surprisingly emotional, after the results and watching David Cameron’s resignation speech, Allison and Nick do not fit the perceived image of expats abroad.They are not old, not retired and not the cartoon figures lampooned as ruddy-faced wine drinkers idling by a pool. In truth, only a small percentage of the estimated 300,000 Brits in France actually are.Stunning: The Feeley family sold up their detached four bedroomed house in Newbury, Berkshire, and ploughed virtually every penny they had into a magnificent, if shabby, five-bedroomed manor house with two independent houses on siteWithin months of moving in 2011 they had created a B&B suite in the main house and a website extolling the glories of their valleyDating from the 1700s and nestled in its own little valley, the honey stone complex of farm buildings already had its own large pool and fishing lakeAnd far from lounging under the present temperatures of 30+degrees, they have spent ‘every hour God sends’ working ceaselessly to create a life and a business.There are an estimated 2 million British nationals living in the EU.The figure is a guess because many have not registered as actually being within the system.Under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty there is a two-year process, which has still to be triggered to begin the breakdown and breakaway of all reciprocal arrangements.Meanwhile all are in legal limbo as to what ‘rights’ will be retained in a possible quid pro quo agreement for the thousands of EU foreign nationals living in the UK.At the moment, EU membership gives the right to residence, to healthcare, schooling, maintenance payments and access to children, cross-border police and research information.All is now up in the air including pensions and property, the main worry for many abroad.France has already warned it will be a quick, even bitter divorce, but pragmatism is likely to kick in when faced with the problems of their own nationals heavily based in the London financial sector.On healthcare alone, France, for example, reclaims from the UK the bills of British pensioners who have paid via National Insurance over the years into the Health Service.If, as has to be the case, that goes, then expats will have to take out hefty insurance policies to cover the expensive, though excellent, provision in many parts of the EU.Most on fixed incomes will be unable to afford it and will seek to return to the NHS, causing major problems for the UK.‘We’ve worked harder, often physically harder, and longer than we ever did before,’ admits Alison, ‘But for life here it has been worth every moment.’ Now 51, Allison and Nick, 57, spent months searching for the perfect house and business before settling on a 2.5 hectare estate close to one of France’s plus beaux villages, Auvillar, in the Tarn et Garonne, six years ago.Alison, a sales and marketing executive with an IT company and Nick, an executive with an American IT company appeared to have it all in England.But when Nick was made redundant, Allison ended up juggling three jobs, as well as bringing up two young daughters, Megan, now 23 and Abigail, now 14.‘We were stressed out frankly,’ remembers Allison. ‘We wanted, desperately needed, a better quality of life; a new life to get us off the treadmill we were on; a fresh start – something better.‘There had to be more than this.’Used to France from spending summers in the South with a pen pal, it seemed an obvious choice for Allison who already spoke good, if not fluent, French.Plus it was close enough to go back and forth to the UK to see family and aging parents.‘France was familiar, it was part of all we both knew and of course, being in the EU, easy to access, live and work in.’They sold up their detached four bedroomed house in Newbury, Berkshire, and ploughed virtually every penny they had into a magnificent, if shabby, five-bedroomed manor house with two independent houses on site.Dating from the 1700s and nestled in its own little valley, the honey stone complex of farm buildings already had its own large pool and fishing lake.They bought from an elderly Baroness whose family had used it as a holiday house.They arrived without their furniture and knew no one. Nick did not speak the language at all and even now admits to knowing only ‘builders’ French.’Idyll: The family sold up after Nick lost his job. ‘We were stressed out frankly,’ remembers Allison. ‘We wanted, desperately needed, a better quality of life.From scratch: The couple built up the shabby complex, with Nick doing everything from plumbing to stone stripping to pool maintenance.But the couple was both realistic and commercially hardheaded in their aims.Within months they had created a B&B suite in the main house and a web site extolling the glories of their valley.Nick began work on the gites, learning as he went along everything from plumbing to stone stripping to pool maintenance.Bit by bit they created two stunning gites aimed at a luxury market but keeping prices realistic.Allison focused on the marketing; kept a contract job for a UK based American company in IT sales and when money was tight, crawled on all fours to pluck strawberries for a local farmer at 9 euros an hour.Between them they formed links and friendships with the local community, and earned respect for all they were doing.Luxury: The couple's website states 'many people find it hard to drag themselves away and revel in the fact that we offer truly child friendly gîtes and Bed and Breakfast'Location: The complex is in Auvillar, a medieval bastide village with its unusual circular corn exchange and views over the Garonne valleyTheir elder daughter, Megan, remained in England to finish her education and their youngest, Abigail, was thrown into the deep end of a French school with minimal language skills.Today she has just taken the French equivalent of GCSEs as a boarder in one of the few private schools. It costs a mere €3000 a year.Her anticipated University choice will be free; her accommodation grant given; even her transportation home at weekends. Education in France is a free right not a privilege for some.‘All that though,’ says Allison, ‘is up in the air. ‘She will be a foreigner within the system once the deal goes through.‘Hopefully though she won’t be once she is French like us. We couldn’t afford to send her back to the UK for either boarding school or university.‘We have no fixed income. We are entitled to health care the same as the French as I am in the tax system and we have a mutuelle (an insurance) to top up the 70 per cent limit. Taste: The couple also run wine tours but say business has slowed this year and are now fearful of the effects of Brexit Concern: The Feeleys have applied for French nationality because they are so anxious about what how the Brexit result will affect them‘People think everything is cheap in France. Once upon a time, perhaps. No longer. All our taxes and social charges continue to rise.‘The last two years we’ve seen a worrying drop in business. People are worried because of the terrorism and the state of emergency.‘The £/€ fluctuates so much they put off coming. This year for the first time we have no bookings, not one, in September.‘And now…this.’Outside, the heat pulses and from every window there is a bucolic view of haystacks, sunflower buds and a heat haze covering gently rising hills. I suggest that perhaps back in the UK there are many who would feel no sympathy for their plight – after all there are no fixed income guarantees there either.‘Of course not,’ says Allison immediately. ‘And we’re not asking for any. We have always, and still do, paid our way and worked our way in life. Haven: The gites complex was the family's refuge from a stressful life in Britain but the Brexit result has left them fearing for the futureBeauty: The Feeleys take pride in the comfort and luxury of the accommodation they run but are worried about their livelihoods following the Brexit result‘Perhaps it would be easier to return, to look for jobs in our own language, to find work whatever it was. Definitely less work than we do here.‘But this, this, is our life. We are part of this country now. We took the chance, the leap, and not blindly. At this moment I’m shocked, emotional and yes, fearful, frightened of what is to come.‘We are in limbo.’The couple, naturally, unlike it seems a number of expats, registered and voted. Obviously for remain?Nick says: ‘Yes but it was last minute. I, we, was going to vote for leave.‘I believed all that Farage said about the bloated EU and how the money would go to the NHS. All lies. It was only in the end when people like the Governor of the Bank of England pointed out the financial facts that I understood.‘For us it was never, ever about immigration. We are immigrants ourselves. And we do believe that there are many things wrong with the EU, many excesses but ultimately, we are better in than out.‘ Too late now.' Empty: In the last few months as business dwindled Allison has also become an independent estate agent, paid only on saleJob loss: Despite the beauty of the surroundings the family are concerned because Allison's contract job with the US company is likely to go in July, because they are outsourcing everything to cheaper CzechoslovakiaIn the last few months as business dwindled Allison has also become an independent estate agent, paid only on sale. Her contract job with the US company is likely to go in July as they are outsourcing everything to cheaper Czechoslovakia.She laughs: ‘Houses are already not selling even at rock bottom prices. Little chance of the Brits buying now with the uncertainty and the £/€ situation.‘At this moment, I can’t see what else we can do except wait, hope we can survive somehow and….’There is often little sympathy for those many in the UK see as having jumped ship for the good, cheap life abroad. Even a slight gloating as to what may be to come for them now.But couples like Nick and Allison perhaps show that being in the EU was much, much more than that.By Nick Fagge in Paris for MailOnlineA retired teacher, a widow and a businessman living in the Dordogne have revealed the financial hardship they face as the value of the pound plummets against the Euro.And they warned of the unintended consequences – including the cost of healthcare and the falling value of their property.Widow Dorothy Smith, 85, originally from Chorley, Lancs, told MailOnline: ‘I think it’s a very bad thing for expats living in France and everyone.‘I stayed up until 5 o’clock in the morning to wait for the outcome and I could believe it. All those stupid people saying stupid things throughout the campaign.‘I was planning to sell my house here in France and go back to England. But I won’t be able to do that now because no one will want to buy it with the value of the pound falling.‘I have a few savings in a French bank account but I mostly rely on my state pensions.‘It is fair to say that I am struggling to get by on as it is.‘But I own my home and my son and grandchildren live near me here in France.‘I fought very hard to be able to vote in this referendum and I voted to remain. But in the end it didn’t make any difference.’Retired teacher Brian Hinchcliffe, 70, moved to France with wife Jenny from Tyneside in 2000.The Brexit vote will have profound consequences for him and other expats in the Dordogne, he warned.‘It feels like a death in the family,’ Mr Hinchcliffe told MailOnline.‘We accepted there was going to be vote about whether to stay in or get out of the EU but we really did not expect this result. We both feel terrible about the outcome.‘We had planned to go out for a drink tonight with our expat friends to celebrate a vote to remain. But now it is going to seem more like a wake.‘We will now have to ask our American friends about all the red tape and hoops they must jump through to live in France, now we will no longer be part of the EU.‘Our daughter works at a call centre in Newcastle where most of the staff are from other EU countries. She says she is going to have to apologise to them today.‘We moved to France in 2000 and because we have been here for over 15 yeasr we were not allowed to vote in the referendum.‘Almost all of the British people we know who live here in France want to stay in the EU. There is only one guy who was for Leave and he spent his working life in Dubai so he can afford it.‘We live off my pension which is paid in pounds so the fall in the value of the pound will affect us.‘When the pound fell to almost parity with the euro a few years ago we struggled.‘In fact the fall in the value of the pound meant a lot of friends could no longer afford to live here and had to return to Britain.‘Out of a group of 20 expat couple there are only four of us left.‘And there are worries about healthcare. Currently we are treated under the French system in which the NHS picks up the majority of the cost. We will have to get insurance to cover us.’Expat businessman Andrew Smith, 59, blamed older voters for jeopardising the future of young Britons.He told MailOnline: ‘I think Brexit will be a disaster.‘I don’t know how much it will affect me because I run my own business here in France, but it a backward step.‘I think it is selfish of the older people to vote to leave the EU when it is the young people – who are in favour of remaining inside – who are going to have to live with the consequences.‘They seem to think that Britain is still an important colonial power that is simply a thing of the past.’

Donald Trump says 'always wrong Obama' and Clinton pushed the British out of Europe by lecturing them to stay - and Americans will be next 'to take their country back'2016-6-24Donald Trump has dramatically said President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton pushed into Britain leaving the European Union - and predicted Americans will make a similar choice in November.He said the president - who in April lectured Britain that it must stay in and threatened it with dire economic consequences if it left - and his would-be Democratic successor had misread the mood of the free world  'She's always misread everything, if you think. She's misread this,' Trump told DailyMail.com of Clinton, during a press conference coinciding with the re-opening of a golf course in the west of Scotland.Both Obama and Clinton urged Britons to vote with the 'Remain' forces, which lost by a 52-48 margin.The result is bragging rights for Trump, who had said that while he wouldn't tell UK voters what to do, if it were up to him he would choose to make Great Britain 'independent' of Brussels.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO Slamming Obama: 'I was actually very surprised that President Obama would've come over here and he would have been so bold as to tell the people over here what to do,' Trump saidThey're to blame: Obama put Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the frame for the UK's decision to quit the European Union Family affair: Donald Trump traveled to his Ayrshire resort of Turnberry with (from left) his son Eric, daughter Ivanka and son Donald JrKey figure: Ivanka Trump also spoke at the press conference at the Trump resort. She and his other children will run the firm if he becomes president, he saidFamily travel: Ivanka Trump was accompanied by her niece Kai Madison Trump, her brother Donald Jr's eldest daughter. Trump said he went to Turnberry 'to support his kids'Obama's lecture to Britain:I actually think his recommendation... caused it to fail.Hillary telling Britain to remain:The only reason she did it is because Obama wanted it. If Obama wanted it the other way, if he said 'Leave', she would have said 'Leave'.Why Britain voted out:People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense.A new referendum on Scottish independence:I don't know that people want to go through that again.Parallels to the presidential election: When people pour into the country, it doesn't work, whether because of crime or other things. You can't unite a country by forcing things down people's throats.Obama, he said, is 'constantly dictating to the world what they should do. The world doesn't listen to him, obviously. You can see that from the vote.'I actually think his recommendation ... caused it to fail,' he claimed.As America's election process becomes more heated, Trump will likely throw the Brexit vote at Clinton as evidence that the women who was once the top U.S. diplomat no longer has her finger on the world's pulse.'The only reason she did it is because Obama wanted it,' he said of Clinton's anti-exit advocacy. 'If Obama wanted it the other way, if he said "Leave," she would have said "Leave." She does whatever he wants her to do.''And you know why,' he added, trailing off. Trump has said in past campaign events that Clinton is toeing Obama's line on a range of issues because she fears a federal indictment over the classified documents found last year among her private emails.Trump had equally little patience with Obama on Friday.'I was actually very surprised that President Obama would've come over here and he would have been so bold as to tell the people over here what to do,' he said.'And I think that a lot of people don't like him, and a lot of people voted – if he had not said it, I think the result might have been different.''I thought it was inappropriate,' Trump reiterated, 'and then [Clinton] doubled down and she did the same thing.''And obviously, for the 219th time, they were wrong. They're always wrong. And that's the problem with them.'Trump told reporters that he sees 'a big parallel' with his messages back home.'I love to see people take their country back, and that's what's happening in the United States,' he said.'People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense,' Trump boomed, hinting at his campaign themes of pushing back against a tide of illegal immigrants entering the U.S. from Mexico.Lone protester: One man - serial British 'prankster' Lee Nelson made it through extensive security to throw swastika-embellished gold balls towards Donald Trump's feetSymbolic protest: 'Sorry Mr. Trump. I forgot to hand them out!' the protester said of the balls.  'Get him out,' the billionaire said, prompting U.S. Secret Service and other security forces to haul him away.At his course: 'People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense,' he said, at a press conference on his Turnberry golf course in Ayrshire, south-west Scotland'People want to see borders. They don't necessarily want people pouring into their country that they don't know who they are,' he said.Speaking on the 9th tee of Trump Turnberry against the dramatic, sea-swept backdrop of his landmark Scottish resort, Trump wore a white 'Make America Great Again' hat and praised the staff who rebuilt the on-site hotel and redesigned large parts of the golf course where the British open has been played.Trump's opening was upstaged by a lone protester - serial British 'prankster' Lee Nelson - who made it through the security cordons and wore a Trump Turnberry sweater.He tossed a few red golf balls bearing Nazi swastikas at Trump's feet, announcing that they were the new driving range balls for the golf course.'Sorry Mr. Trump. I forgot to hand them out!' he said, his hands holding two more balls and shaking in the moment as close to 150 cameras focused on him.'Get him out,' the billionaire said, prompting U.S. Secret Service and other security forces to haul him away.Scotland's 'right to roam' laws make it unusually challenging for authorities to secure outdoor spaces. The anti-Trump activist, security staff said, simply walked onto the golf course unchallenged.Beyond Brexit, Trump said he wouldn't be surprised to see the whole of the EU break apart, saying that 'it looks like it's on its way and we'll see what happens.'He said 'proud' German friends of his who are accustomed to 'bragging about their country' are now fleeing their homeland because of the flood of migrants welcomed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.'Building safe zones in Syria - great idea,' he said, but criticized Europe for embracing refugees by the trainload.Promised protest: Left-wing activists had claimed that thousands of protesters would descend on Turnberry but in the event there were tiny numbers Is that it? This was the protest expected to number in the thousands. Trump said, 'We counted them. There were 43.'Heavy security: Mounted police were deployed in case of trouble but the numbers of left-wing anti-Trump activists were extremely smallAnd he predicted that Americans would ultimately come down against their government 'taking them into the United States by the thousands. We don't know who they are.''When people pour into the country, it doesn't work, whether because of crime or other things,' he said. 'You can't unite a country by forcing things down people's throats.'But he stopped short at the notion that Texas, Vermont or another independent-minded U.S. state might take a cue from the Brexit vote and start a bona fide secession movement.DailyMail.com asked him on a post-presser rope line if he was concerned about a 'Texit' or a 'Vermexit.''Oh, yeah!' he piped up, laughing uproariously. 'That'll be next, right?'The billionaire's staff promised a press conference, 'rain or shine.' Despite a downpour nearby in the mid-morning hours, Mother Nature stayed the clouds and a hot sun beat down, cooking TV camera crews and baking off a morning coating of fog.By the time The Donald made his entrance, complete with a bagpiper as his herald, the heat and calm winds could be mistaken for an April day in Miami.The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples. They have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy. A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense. The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration.Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first. They will have the chance to reject today’s rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.I hope America is watching, it will soon be time to believe in America again.Making the trip with Trump were his daughter Ivanka, son Eric, their spouses, and son Donald Jr, and grandson Kai Madison Trump - Donald Jr's daughter. Trump's wife Melania stayed home in New York, according to a campaign aide.The results of Thursday's 'Brexit' vote were nearly guaranteed to dominate the anticipation of Friday morning's event.Trump called the vote 'truly historic' during the press conference.A majority of about 52 percent of voters chose to exit the European Union, sending the value of the British Pound into free-fall and panicking investors across the globe.But to Trump, whatever pain comes is the price of freedom – and a nose-dive form the Pound could bring with it a tourism boost throughout Great Britain.He said in a statement after the stunning results came in that if he should become the U.S. president, his administration would 'strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense.''The whole world is more peaceful and stable,' he said, 'when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump administration.''Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence,' he added.'Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first.''I hope America is watching,' he concluded.Trump himself said this week that if it had been up to him, the 'Leave' vote would prevail – and it did.President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both backed the 'Remain' side of the contentious referendum.Whoever the next American president is, he or she will have to build bridges with a new British prime minister.David Cameron said Friday that he would step down by October and give a new PM the task of managing the two-year process of unwinding Britain's ties with Brussels.Scotland, the land of Trump's mother's birth, provided an odd political backdrop for Trump, as its voters were strongly against leaving the EU – by a 62-38 margin.Its citizens are now expected to hold a second independence vote of their own, which could pull them out of Great Britain and set them up to separately rejoin the EU.'That's up to the people of Scotland. We've been through this,' Trump said Friday.Pointing the finger: It was on this presidential visit to the UK that Obama told the country it would 'be at the back of the queue' for trade deals if it voted out. Trump today said that probably tipped voters to leaveThe billionaire arrived in his 'Trump' emblazoned helicopter at the Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire to officially open the revamped resort he bought in 2014, just an hour after Prime Minister David Cameron said he intended to stand down in OctoberBut citing a 'very, very close vote' the first time around, he said: 'I don't know that people want to go through that again.'A small gaggle of protesters lined the Turnberry country road approaching Friday's event, including one holding a small sign that read: 'Listen to us and then GO HOME.'Trump proudly announced on Friday that despite predictions of thousands of demonstrators, only 43 showed up.'We counted them,' he boasted. 'They said there would be thousands.'Trump Turnberry is one of nine branded properties where the Republican presidential candidate has held press events in 2015 and 2016, including a host of golf courses, Trump Tower, his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, and a hotel under construction in Washington, D.C.He is expected to make an appearance Saturday at another Trump golf course in Aberdeen, a five-hour drive to the northeast.The real estate tycoon bristled against a question about why he was in Scotland instead of campaigning in the U.S., saying he was there 'because I support my children.'The Trump kids, particularly Eric, were responsible for the Turnberry property's redevelopment.'This is, a little bit, what we're going to do to the United States,' he said, complaining about the nation's 'rotting infrastructure ... the bridges are a disaster. The roads are a disaster.''It's a place that has to be fixed. And there's nobody who knows how to fix things like me,' Trump boasted.And in a parting shot to Clinton, he declared that his campaign against her had only just begun.'Ohio's even, Pennsylvania's even, the national polls are getting very close,' he observed.'She's spent a lot of money, and we're even!'

Another reason to vote Brexit? New figures show Britain's population has risen by 500,000 in ONE YEAR to more than 65million 2016-6-23The UK population has passed the 65million mark, new official figures revealed today. The country grew by more than a quarter of a million people last year due to high net migration and more births than deaths. It means the UK population has gone up by nearly five million – around eight per cent – in just 10 years. The numbers could provide a last-minute boost for the Brexit camp, which has campaigned heavily on immigration and the impact EU freedom of movement has on numbers of people arriving in the UK. Crowded: The UK population has passed the 65million mark last year after the country grew by 513,000 in just one year Natural growth - more births than deaths - of 171,800 and net international migration of 335,600 helped push the number of people living in the country to 65.1million as of mid-2015. This was an increase over the year of 513,000 - the equivalent of 0.8 per cent.  Support for Vote Leave is widely thought to have gathered pace after official figures in late May put net migration at 333,000, and showed that more than half - 184,000 - came from the EU. Figures also revealed that 77,000 EU citizens came to Britain without an offer of a job in one year.Vote Leave seized on the results as further proof of the need to quit the EU.  ‘The only way to get back control over our borders is to Vote Leave today, Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave said this morning. 'In the last ten years as many people as live in Birmingham have moved here from another EU country. That puts a huge strain on our NHS and our schools.’If we Vote Leave, we can take back control and introduce a new Australian-style points-based immigration system. Today is your last chance to do that: go out and Vote Leave today.’  Estimates of the level of the UK population at the middle of last year have been scheduled for release today since last year.That means they are not covered by ‘purdah’ rules that say Whitehall should not release sensitive information during an election or referendum campaign.ONS calculations of the population released in June last year put numbers in the middle of 2014 at 64,596,800, and the increase over 12 months at 491,100.However, the estimates released today  show faster growth because last year net migration – the number of people added to the population after both immigration and emigration have been taken into account - was running at 259,700.In the 12 months to the end of June last year period covered in today’s figures, net migration hit a record 336,000.Since immigration pushes up birthrates – because immigrant women are usually of childbearing age and are likely to have more children than women born in Britain – immigration is currently thought to be responsible for around two thirds of population increase.The ONS has said that the population may reach almost 80 million by 2039 if migration and birthrates continue at high levels. The projection of over 79 million is nearly 10 million higher than the level which Labour ministers – who presided over the 2000s boom in Eastern European immigration – said would never be reached.If the statistics show the predicted increase, then the UK population will have gone up by nearly five million – around eight per cent – in just 10 years (file image)The ONS figures were  released at 9.30am this morning, just two-and-a-half hours after polling stations open, at a time when there will be more than 12 hours of voting left.They may have a major impact through reporting by broadcasters and websites during the day. Polling days usually have no significant campaign news and broadcasters have little to report until counting begins late in the evening.A spokesman for the BBC declined yesterday to say whether the Corporation’s new outlets would report the figures.The equivalent report last June attracted heavy attention from BBC reporters, who have been paying greater attention to immigration over the past few years as the anxiety of voters has become plain.Vote Leave campaigners have  played on concerns over rapid population increase and its effect on schools, hospitals, transport, utilities and the availability of housing.Lord Green of the Migration Watch think tank said yesterday: ‘It is a sign of the times that our population increase is now around half a million every year. If immigration continues at current levels we can expect the population to increase by 10million over the next 20 years and then continue to go up.’The UK population is thought to have passed 60million in 2005, at a time of very high Eastern European immigration.

'Only a few lunatics want to join the EU now': Switzerland WITHDRAWS application to become a European Union member state one week before the Brexit vote2016-6-16Politicians in Switzerland have voted to withdraw the country's long-standing European Union application, a week before Britain decides on its own EU membership.Thomas Minder, counsellor for Schaffhausen state and an active promoter of the concept of 'Swissness,' told Neue Zürcher Zeitung he was eager to 'close the topic fast and painlessly' as only 'a few lunatics' may want to join the EU now.A total of 27 members of parliament's upper house voted to invalidate the 1992 application, backing up an earlier decision by the lower house. Only 13 senators voted against while two abstained.Switzerland first applied to join the EU in 1992 but after 24 years will now give formal notice to BrusselsThe original motion, introduced by the conservative Swiss People’s Party MP, Lukas Reimann, received overwhelming support from law-makers in the lower house back in March, with 126 National Council deputies voting in favor, 46 against.Switzerland will now give formal notice to the EU to consider its application withdrawn, the country’s foreign minister, Didier Burkhalter, was quoted as saying by the paper. Hannes Germann, also representing Schaffhausen, compared the symbolic importance to Iceland’s decision to drop its membership bid in 2015.Switzerland’s long-standing application to join has had little impact on domestic politics for more than 20 years“Iceland had the courage and withdrew the application for membership, so no volcano erupted,” he said.Switzerland’s long-standing application to join has had little impact on domestic politics for more than 20 years, after it suspended accession negotiations in 1992, following a referendum to join the European Economic Area.However, the Swiss public narrowly rejected EEA membership.Some have even argued that the vote was unnecessary because the EU no longer regards Switzerland as an official candidate to join.Filippo Lombardi, from the Christian Democratic People’s Party, said  it was 'not very clever to discuss it once again,' calling the whole thing 'a bit ridiculous'.Switzerland, never a member of EU, shares free trade with the union and free movement of people as part of the Schengen zone.The British public will have their say on their own country's EU membership through a hotly-anticipated referendum on Thursday

What happens next? MailOnline's guide to how the world will change after Britain votes for Brexit in historic EU referendum result2016-6-24Britain has voted clearly in favour of leaving the EU, but that is just the start of a very long process before we officially untangle ourselves from the network of institutions in Brussels. The historic result could see us embarking on a path to an enlightened era of prosperous global trade, freed from the shackles of unelected Brussels bureaucracy.Or if you listen to the Remain camp, it could be the end of Western civilisation, with the continent descending into war and pensioners going hungry. Whichever side of the European argument you fall, the only certainty seems to be that things from now on will be pretty lively. So what will the next 100 days of Brexit Britain look like?  David Cameron will shortly appear outside Downing Street to concede defeatToday  A shattered and emotional David Cameron has announced he is resigning as Prime Minister as he gave a statement outside 10 Downing Street at 8.20am this morning. He spoke to the Queen to alert her of his decision to stand aside in three months time - allowing a new Tory leader to be elected and installed by October.The Prime Minister promised to implement the wishes of the British people, but his speech was necessarily short on detail and he said he would not immediately trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the formal mechanism for leaving the EU His main focus in his speech outside Number 10 was an appeal for stability and unity in a bid to avoid further financial and political turmoil. Meanwhile the Chancellor George Osborne was heading up emergency discussions between the Treasury, Bank of England and European Central Bank.They will each activate contingency plans to shore up the pound and the euro, while injecting liquidity to banks to ensure the system keeps working.  Outside Downing Street this morning Mr Cameron said it would not be right for him to be the 'captain of the ship' while the UK negotiated its exit from the EU. But he will stay on as Prime Minister for three months to calm the markets. It will also allow the Conservative party to elect a new leader - almost certainly to be Brexit-supporting Boris Johnson - who will lead Britain into negotiating its official withdrawal from the EU. In his statement today, Mr Cameron sought to reassure EU migrants living in the UK and expats living on the continent that their circumstances will not change - at least in the short term. Goods and services will still be bought and sold between UK and European firms and consumers, he added in a bid to stave off fears of a hit to Britain's trading economy. When he made his speech at a press conference later in the morning, Mr Johnson agreed with Mr Cameron that Britain should not trigger Article 50 until a battle plan for negotiations have been drawn up.  June 28-29EU leaders are due to gather for a summit in Brussels, at which there will be only one topic - the Brexit vote.They could even bring the meeting forward by a few days if their anxiety is great enough. Mr Cameron is expected to formally notify them of our intention to leave, trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the legal process for quitting the 28 nation bloc.That starts the clock on a two-year period during which we negotiate a new set of arrangements in areas such as trade, justice and reciprocal visas. The UK can leave earlier than that if terms are easily found. But if there is no deal by the end of the time we will be outside without any special provisions - meaning much higher trade tariffs. However, the PM may hold off as some Leave campaigners do not want to invoke Article 50 at all, believing it puts our negotiators at a disadvantage.Instead we could try to force the EU to strike a deal without imposing a time limit - but that may depend on whether other states are willing to play ball. European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has already warned that 'deserters' will not be treated kindly. But leaders will have to navigate the whole process as they go because quitting the EU is an unprecedented move.Only semi-independent Greenland has quit the EU before, and that was 30 years ago when the island had a population of just 56,000. It can be argued that Algeria left too - when it stopped being part of France in the 1960s. Britain will become the first fully-signed up member of the European Union to leave after voters backed Brexit in yesterday's historic referendum. Only Greenland has left the union and that was more than 30 years ago, when the union was called the European CommunityDavid Cameron (left) will tell European Council President Donald Tusk (right) and EU leaders of Britain's desire to leave after losing the EU referendum July 6 As the immediate shock of the Brexit vote eases, the government machine gears up to the task of negotiating a new deal with the EU and replacing other bilateral trade agreements. Despite volatility on the markets, the public will almost certainly be surprised to find that little changes in their everyday lives. Importantly, there is virtually no chance that George Osborne's threat of a post-Brexit 'punishment' Budget will happen. That is partly because victorious Conservative Eurosceptics will have demanded Mr Osborne is moved from No11, but also because the hit to the real economy will not have been as immediate as some made out.On July 6, Mr Cameron will be able to lead the government response to the publication of the long-awaited Iraq Inquiry report. Shortly afterwards he is due to attend a Nato summit.David Cameron will probably stay on in Number 10 until a swiftly-held Conservative leadership contest can be held - most likely to be won by leading Brexit campaigners such as Boris Johnson (right) or Michael Gove (left)July 21Parliament is due to rise for its summer break, but there will be little rest for ministers as they are consumed by the negotiations. The civil service has been quietly contingency planning for the possibility of our departure, with every department set to be affected by the seismic changes.  But Mr Cameron, if he is still in place, will be largely peripheral to the process.  Having been so closely associated with the Remain campaign, it is almost inconceivable that Mr Cameron would be regarded as a credible head negotiator.It is possible that another, Brexit-supporting minister such as Michael Gove could be appointed to oversee the work. Vote Leave said the government should invite figures from other parties, business, the law and civil society to join the negotiating team to 'get a good deal in the national interest'. By now the Tory leadership contest is likely to be in full swing.The party's rules mean MPs nominate two candidates, who are then put forward for an election by the wider membership. While Mr Cameron could stay on as PM to oversee the initial stages of leaving the EU, he will almost certainly only be a caretaker while the Tories choose a new leader. Brexit champion Boris Johnson would almost certainly emerge victorious.Mr Cameron would be able to lead the response to the long-awaited Iraq Inquiry report on July 6, and attend a Nato summit shortly afterwards.But he is likely to become irrelevant to the main workings of government, as the machine focuses on the task of organising the UK's new status. Chancellor George Osborne, who would share in Mr Cameron's ignominious defeat, also face being sidelined along with other prominent pro-EU figures like Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could struggle to hang on to his job after criticism of his half-hearted campaign.As for the nation's finances, sterling is expected to drop in the short term at least, hitting holiday makers and importers but helping exporters.The FTSE could also be significantly lower as investment dries up pending clarity on the shape of the new trading and border arrangements. Boris Johnson is now in prime position to take over from David Cameron after Britain voted for Brexit Mid-August  The cracks could quickly start to show in the rest of the EU, as other countries wonder whether they too can forge another course outside the club.EU council president Donald Tusk has questioned whether the Brussels club - and indeed 'Wetern civilisation' - can survive Brexit.And senior figures such as German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble have also admitted the grouping will be significantly weakened.Political turmoil will be perhaps the biggest threat to the UK. If the Conservative leadership takes a similar length of time as in 2005, this is around when the successor to Mr Cameron could be announced.Given the need for someone to take charge of the talks, it is likely there would be a strong desire to move as fast as possible.Mr Johnson would be in a position to win a very strong mandate, as the politician who did the most to deliver the Brexit vote.SeptemberParliament is due back, and while the early autumn sitting it usually viewed as a sop to those who complain MPs do not work hard enough, this year it could be extremely busy.Vote Leave has called for legislation in the current session of Parliament to 'end the European Court of Justice's control over national security and allow the government to deport criminals from the EU'.The Brexiteers have also pledged abolish the 5 per cent rate of VAT on household energy bills by amending the Value Added Tax Act 1994.Other parliamentary actions promised by the Leave campaign include ending the automatic right of all EU citizens to enter the UK, and - finally - repealing the European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill.That is the legislation that guarantees the supremacy of EU law to domestic rules.However, it is not clear how fast the Brexiteers will be able to cut the ties to Brussels.Around three quarters of MPs support EU membership, and some are already considering how that weight of numbers can be used to limit the impact of a Leave vote.  There could be efforts to defy the public will altogether, or keep us in the single market rather than quitting the bloc altogether.Iain Duncan Smith has said that MPs who ignore the outcome of the referendum it would trigger a 'constitutional crisis' and potentially a snap general election. October 5 The political party conference season is always frantic, but this year it will have an even greater significance. The realignment of politics set in train by the referendum would have been huge for Britain and for Europe.Just after the first hundred days draws to a close, the new Tory Prime Minister could take to the stage in Birmingham to address activists.Mr Johnson - if he has emerged victorious - would be able to argue that the UK has made a start in its new life independent from Brussels.  

My friend David Cameron knows full well what remaining in the EU means for immigration - we simply can't control it, writes former adviser STEVE HIILTON2016-6-21You may be surprised to read that I believe the Prime Minister has done everything in his power to control immigration. The problem is that as the leader of an EU member state, he doesn’t have enough power to control immigration.That goes to the heart not just of the migration debate, but of this entire referendum campaign and the decision we need to make as a nation in two days’ time.In all the years I worked as an adviser to David Cameron, he expressed a very clear point of view about immigration, one that I share. We believe that immigration has enriched this country’s economy and society. As the son of immigrant parents, I feel this particularly strongly; I will forever be grateful to this country for the incredible opportunities it has given me.Steve Hilton working with the Prime Minister in the Cabinet room of Number 10 Downing Street, when he was employed as an aide to David CameronAnd now, as an immigrant myself — to another country that prides itself on its open, inclusive character, the United States — I am doubly grateful for the fact that we live in a world where people can move freely and put down roots in places far from where they were born.On many occasions, in public and private, I heard David Cameron set out his belief that precisely to protect this proud British heritage of welcoming people to our shores, immigration had to be controlled.He spoke approvingly of the fact that in the Eighties, Margaret Thatcher’s governments got the balance right on immigration, and that this contributed to the important and unequivocally positive fact that no party of the extreme Right ever managed to win significant support for a xenophobic anti-immigrant agenda.He deplored the fact that subsequent Labour governments lost control of immigration, and was determined to get a grip. In office, I saw at first hand how seriously he took this responsibility. He had announced a clear commitment — to reduce the overall level of immigration to the tens of thousands annually — and understood very well that the public would rightly hold him to account for such a clear promise.Immigration, alongside the threat of Islamic terrorism, was one of the policy areas that, in my observation, most occupied his time and focus. If anything, there were times when I wished he would focus more on other priorities; things that were perhaps closer to my heart.David Cameron, who was told four years ago his immigration target was 'impossible' while Britain was in the EUBut as the elected Prime Minister, he rightly got to call the shots.At the time, one of the main ways we assessed the success of our most important policies was through ‘stock take’ meetings. These involved ministers and civil servants responsible for a particular policy coming to No 10 for a long session, chaired by the Prime Minister, during which we could really get stuck into the details of how a particular reform was going.I remember the meetings on immigration towards the end of my time in Downing Street. Everyone around the table, in some way or another, was working hard to try to deliver the government’s commitment.We were presented with analysis of the numbers of people coming to Britain through various routes, the impact of policy changes we had already made, and projections stretching into the future.The news was not good. We were way off target; indeed, the numbers were going in the wrong direction. We explored various policy options — and I’m sure that process continued after I left the government in May 2012. But I recall very clearly one of the points that was made to us by the expert officials in the room.We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which, of course, insists on the free movement of people within it.Now let me make one thing clear. The Remain campaign and its supporters say that leaving the EU will not on its own solve our immigration problems, and they are right about that. Leaving the EU is not a silver bullet. But, as we were advised in government, it is impossible for the ‘tens of thousands’ target to be met unless we leave — or negotiate an end to, or exception from, the free movement rules, which is an option Brussels has always refused to countenance.In my view, the target itself is set at the wrong level. I would actually like to see more entrepreneurs, engineers, computer scientists — as well as those in genuine need of refuge — welcomed to Britain. I think that would help boost our economy and strengthen, not weaken, our society.Others might take a different view: you could judge the Prime Minister’s target to be about right. Or too high. That’s what elections are for, to debate things like that.But the point is, whatever the policy, whatever people vote for, it’s not unreasonable to expect that the Prime Minister of the day is able to deliver it. That is simply not possible in the current, unreformed — and in my view unreformable — EU.Mr Hilton says the problem is that as the leader of an EU member state, Mr Cameron doesn’t have enough power to control immigrationYou don’t need to sit in a ‘stock take’ meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we’re in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it. Here are the ways in which this is a disaster.It’s an economic disaster because it means we have to clamp down on immigration that could benefit our economy (skilled labour) in favour of immigration from the EU that often doesn’t (unskilled labour).I remember fighting endless battles with the Home Secretary Theresa May simply to get her agreement to the introduction of an Entrepreneur Visa that would allow people from overseas with real potential to start their businesses here. It happened in the end, but only after massive internal opposition and watering down.More broadly, almost every day in government we heard complaints about incredible individuals, whom we ought to have welcomed with a red carpet, being harassed and treated like second-class citizens by our immigration authorities.Such people included Nobel Prize-winning scientists from Russia, some of our biggest investors from India, or even high-spending shoppers from China.The Prime Minister’s ex-closest aide Steve Hilton, pictured, who attended the meetings with senior Whitehall officials in 2012, said Cameron was warned against the target by civil servantsOur broken immigration system is a social disaster because the decency and tolerance of the British people, virtues that our politicians so love to talk about when it suits them, are mocked when they see their local communities and public services overwhelmed by sudden and unplanned-for arrivals of people in large numbers — the kind of dramatic changes which, needless to say, don’t affect the neighbourhoods inhabited by our insular ruling elite.And, of course, all this is a political disaster because, as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have said, when politicians make promises they can’t keep, it undermines not just faith in individual politicians but everybody’s faith in the democratic process itself.In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister re-affirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable. When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave.For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what Gove and Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics.Mr Hilton says that as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have said, when politicians make promises they can’t keep, it undermines not just faith in individual politicians but everybody’s faith in the democratic process itselfThere’s a broader argument here, too, because the EU debate isn’t just about immigration, which is why it is so offensive for the Remain campaign to argue, as George Osborne put it, that those like me who want to leave the EU ‘want a meaner, narrower Britain’.The fact is that with areas such as the economy, the environment, our legal system — which affect people’s everyday lives in Britain — membership of the EU makes it impossible for the elected government to govern our country in the true sense of the word.It seems to me that here in Britain, and especially in this referendum campaign, our insular ruling elite is playing with fire.By dismissing — or worse, demonising — people’s desire for control over the things that matter to them, and their perfectly reasonable expectation that the government they elect should have the power to deliver its promises, the rulers are the ones stoking the anger they decry.Undeliverable promises. An ungovernable country. An untrusted political establishment. This is what the EU has helped do to our country. We can’t go on like this. It’s time for change. It’s time to leave. 

'Freedom, liberty and justice will prevail over the hate that killed her': Osborne cancels a major referendum speech to issue a defiant and emotional tribute to Jo Cox 2016-6-16George Osborne last night cancelled a major address on the economy and referendum to pay an emotional tribute to Jo Cox after she was killed in LeedsGeorge Osborne last night cancelled a major address on the economy and referendum to pay an emotional tribute to Jo Cox.He said all MPs had been rocked by the 'appalling, shattering news' of Mrs Cox's death when it was confirmed by West Yorkshire Police shortly after 5pm.But a week before a democratic vote that will define his career, Mr Osborne said 'freedom, liberty and justice' would prevail over the 'hatred that killed her'.The Chancellor welcomed the decision to suspend campaigning on the EU referendum with less than a week to polling day out of respect for the tragic events in Birstall.Mr Osborne, speaking at the annual Mansion House dinner, said Mrs Cox had died 'serving her constituents, serving our democracy'.And Mr Osborne reflected on how all MPs making themselves available to their constituents is 'one of the virtues of our Parliamentary democracy'.He said: 'It's what makes the way we govern ourselves very different from many others.'To be an effective representative, all of us who are MPs engage with their communities, talk to everyone and anyone, hold constituency surgeries and must be prepared to stand up and argue publicly for what we believe.'Jo did all of these things.'The Chancellor said the Batley and Spen MP had been 'liked and respected across the House' after making an immediate impact since her election last year.He said shed changed attitudes and helped change Government policy despite being a new, backbench, opposition MP.Mr Osborne said: ' She will never know how many lives she helped transform.'Today, doing that job, she senselessly lost her own life.'Not since Ian Gow lost his life to an IRA bomb twenty six years ago has an MP been murdered, but others since have faced attack, injury and intimidation.'Mr Osborne said all MPs had been rocked by the 'appalling, shattering news' of Mrs Cox's death when it was confirmed by West Yorkshire Police shortly after 5pm Mr Osborne, speaking at the annual Mansion House dinner, said Mrs Cox had died 'serving her constituents'The Chancellor appeared deep in thought with his head bowed as he sat at the dinner at Mansion HouseThe Chancellor continued: ' We believe in Parliamentary democracy.'MPs have the privilege of representing the views of those who voted for them and those who did not. We believe in tolerance.'In the words of her husband, Brendan, Jo would have wanted us to unite against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn't have a creed, race or religion. It is poisonous.'And we believe in freedom, liberty and justice.'Mr Osborne said the day's 'horrible events' were an 'assault on all these values'.But in a defiant conclusion, he said: 'But we know that these values, no matter how they have been challenged in the past, have always prevailed, prevail today and they will always prevail.'For they are the values of Great Britain, our great democracy.' 

UK population 'rises 500,000 to 65million': Figure has gone up by nearly five million in just ten years2016-6-22The country’s population has passed the 65million mark, new official figures are likely to show today.The population estimates due to be released by the Office for National Statistics are expected to show the number of people living in the UK went up by more than half a million in a single year.If so, then the UK population will have gone up by nearly five million – around eight per cent – in just 10 years.The numbers could provide a last-minute boost for the Brexit camp, which has campaigned heavily on immigration and the impact EU freedom of movement has on numbers of people arriving in the UK.Crowded: Population estimates due to be released by the Office for National Statistics are expected to show the number of people living in the UK went up by more than half a million in a single year (file image)Support for Vote Leave is widely thought to have gathered pace after official figures in late May put net migration at 333,000, and showed that 77,000 EU citizens came to Britain in a year.Estimates of the level of the UK population at the middle of last year have been scheduled for release today since last year.That means they are not covered by ‘purdah’ rules that say Whitehall should not release sensitive information during an election or referendum campaign.ONS calculations of the population released in June last year put numbers in the middle of 2014 at 64,596,800, and the increase over 12 months at 491,100.However, the estimates due to be released today may show faster growth because last year net migration – the number of people added to the population after both immigration and emigration have been taken into account - was running at 259,700.In the 12 months to the end of June last year period covered in today’s figures, net migration hit a record 336,000.Since immigration pushes up birthrates – because immigrant women are usually of childbearing age and are likely to have more children than women born in Britain – immigration is currently thought to be responsible for around two thirds of population increase.The ONS has said that the population may reach almost 80 million by 2039 if migration and birthrates continue at high levels. The projection of over 79 million is nearly 10 million higher than the level which Labour ministers – who presided over the 2000s boom in Eastern European immigration – said would never be reached.If the statistics show the predicted increase, then the UK population will have gone up by nearly five million – around eight per cent – in just 10 years (file image)The ONS figures were due to be released at 9.30am this morning, just two-and-a-half hours after polling stations open, at a time when there will be more than 12 hours of voting left.They may have a major impact through reporting by broadcasters and websites during the day. Polling days usually have no significant campaign news and broadcasters have little to report until counting begins late in the evening.A spokesman for the BBC declined yesterday to say whether the Corporation’s new outlets would report the figures.The equivalent report last June attracted heavy attention from BBC reporters, who have been paying greater attention to immigration over the past few years as the anxiety of voters has become plain.Vote Leave campaigners have  played on concerns over rapid population increase and its effect on schools, hospitals, transport, utilities and the availability of housing.Lord Green of the Migration Watch think tank said yesterday: ‘It is a sign of the times that our population increase is now around half a million every year. If immigration continues at current levels we can expect the population to increase by 10million over the next 20 years and then continue to go up.’The UK population is thought to have passed 60million in 2005, at a time of very high Eastern European immigration.

Banking giants consider moving thousands of jobs out of Britain after Brexit vote as big businesses warn of a profits slump2016-6-24City rocked: Banking giant JP Morgan is reportedly considering moving staff from his London HQ to Paris after today's Brexit voteSeveral of the world's biggest banks are already considering sending  thousands of jobs out of Britain after today's Brexit win.JP Morgan, the globe's biggest investment bank, and BNP Paribas, France's financial giant, are reportedly looking at whether they should now move their London bases to Paris.But American giant Morgan Stanley has denied rumours that it is planning to move 2,000 investment banking jobs to Frankfurt and Dublin.It came as British Airways owner IAG  issued a profit warning following the UK's decision to leave the EU.The company's share price tanked 19 per cent to 425.6p in trading on Friday morning.City workers  are braced for months of pain as banks and financial institutions begin the process of considering whether to slash jobs or relocate to Europe in the wake of Brexit. HSBC and Goldman Sachs all said prior to the vote that thousands of jobs in the City of London could be moved to the continent in the event of Brexit.Sarah Phillips, partner at solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said the Brexit vote will have a 'big impact' on people working in Britain's financial services sector.She added: 'Many banks, insurers and fund managers who have large businesses in continental Europe could consider relocating to Paris or Frankfurt and senior staff will either lose their roles or have to move to another country.'Some global investment banks, such as JPMorgan, have said that Brexit would lead to a significant loss of jobs in the UK.'HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver said in February that a vote to leave could see 5,000 London-based investment bankers move out of London to Paris. Jamie Dimon, head of JP Morgan, said earlier this month that up to 4,000 jobs could be hit.Although banks have been cautious on Friday in making any brash statements regarding their future plans, experts are forecasting that large scale redundancies could be on the cards.Virgin founder Richard Branson said today it 'a very sad decision that will do huge damage to Britain's prosperity & Europe's stability'O2 Telefónica UK chief Ronan Dunne said: 'Whatever we think on IN/OUT, people were simply unconvinced by the case to #Remain. We have failed our citizens rather than them failing us.'Dixons Carphone Warehouse boss Sebastian James said: 'Feels strange and unsettling following the vote but we are the same, our company is the same, and our job is the same. Making people happy'.Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde & Co, said: 'At a more fundamental level, unless the financial services passporting rules are resolved in the UK's favour, then many large financial services businesses are likely to relocate to within the EU - meaning large scale redundancies would be highly probable.' Many banks and businesses joined the Remain campaign and warned of catastrophe have today looked to reassure instead.Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein has said the bank respects the decision of the British electorate, while HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said that 'we are today entering a new era for Britain and British business'.Dixons Carphone Warehouse boss Sebastian James said: 'Feels strange and unsettling following the vote but we are the same, our company is the same, and our job is the same.

Our priority is to continue providing reliable, affordable energy to our customers in Europe and the UK.'David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte UK: 'We are likely to see a period of uncertainty''The British public have spoken and made clear that they see the UK's interests best-served by leaving the European Union. While the UK has opted for a future outside the EU, Britain remains a competitive, innovative and highly-skilled economy and an attractive place for business'. 

We have more in common with Australia and India than Latvia and Slovakia: The PM's ex-Trade Envoy says we should be doing more business with our REAL friends and partners in the Commonwealth 2016-6-17Far from being at the risk of isolation, we are in the extraordinarily fortunate position of enjoying a key part in the Commonwealth, writes Lord MarlandWhatever the outcome of next week’s EU vote, Britain has not made the most of its pivotal role in the Commonwealth.Far from being at the risk of isolation, we are in the extraordinarily fortunate position of enjoying a key part in the Commonwealth, which covers more than a fifth of the world’s land mass and embraces 2.3 billion citizens — one-third of the world’s entire population.Rather than shivering on the sidelines in the event of Brexit, Britain could become a more significant global player by building on its membership of the Commonwealth, with the Queen and the Royal Family working tirelessly at its heart.It’s an organisation that was originally forged by the British Empire, but now flourishes through mutual friendship.In its unique origins and voluntary structure lie both the Commonwealth’s strength and huge potential benefits for Britain.We are linked to the 52 other Commonwealth nations with ties of language, heritage, justice, culture, sport and, yes, even humour.It is no exaggeration to say that most Britons would have much more in common with people from Australia or India than those from EU nations such as Latvia and Slovakia.The Commonwealth remains an untapped resource for Britain. Sadly, in recent years, the advantages of this enormous alliance have been downplayed or over-looked. This disdain has partly been caused by our deeper involvement with the European Union, which has focused our gaze narrowly on Europe, rather than the wider world.Undoubtedly, our entry into the Common Market in 1973 meant the diminution of our relationships with Commonwealth partners such as New Zealand. And that process of neglect has accelerated over the subsequent four decades.Despite the renewed energy being shown by UK ministers, it is a telling fact that within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, there are more than 100 officials working on our relations with the EU, but no more than eight on our relations with the Commonwealth.In the same vein, during the 13 years of the Labour government from 1997, there was not a single British prime ministerial visit to Malaysia, even though it has a rapidly growing economy and is an increasingly important power in the Pacific region.This, happily, has been rectified by the current government and trade between the two countries has leapt.Scroll down for video The UK is a key part in the Commonwealth, which covers more than a fifth of the world’s land mass and embraces 2.3 billion citizens — one-third of the world’s entire population To disregard the importance of the Commonwealth is the height of folly. The institution is predicted to be key to a successful future for Britain. In economic terms alone, many of the Commonwealth nations could soon be major powerhouses.Nigeria, for instance, has a population of around 180 million and is predicted to be larger than the U.S. by 2030, while India, the world’s largest democracy, has recently enjoyed growth rates of more than 6 per cent.In 2013, the size of the Commonwealth’s economy overtook that of the faltering Eurozone. It has been estimated that the Commonwealth produces around 17 per cent of the world’s entire gross product when measured in terms of purchasing power. Indeed, the Commonwealth is helping to fuel global prosperity by promoting international trade.A host of studies have suggested that there is a ‘Commonwealth factor’ in global trade, meaning it is, on average, 19 per cent cheaper to trade with Commonwealth countries, thanks to legal structures and cultural similarities.Moreover, the growing wealth of the Commonwealth can provide investment in crucial infrastructure projects in Britain, as we see in the vast regeneration of the Battersea Power Station site in London, one of the biggest redevelopments in Europe. Tellingly, it is backed by Malaysia, not a Eurozone power.Yet there is far more scope for Britain to utilise its Commonwealth ties for economic advancement.We are linked to the 52 other Commonwealth nations - including Australia - with ties of language, heritage, justice, culture, sport and, yes, even humourWe have not only the gift of the English language in common, but also a basis of law established by the British, which can serve as invaluable conduits for commerce. The City of London remains the dominant financial centre for most Commonwealth countries.Relatively modest trade facilitation measures and improvements in logistics are thought likely to increase Commonwealth exports by £86 billion annually, boosting Commonwealth GDP by £122 billion and creating 24 million new jobs.Some critics might suggest that one of the Commonwealth’s problems is that its members are from all corners of the earth, so it could never form a regional bloc like the European Union. But this is outdated thinking.In the age of mass transit, cheap travel, the internet and satellite communication, geographical proximity counts for far less today than it did in the Seventies, when Britain entered the Common Market. In any case, the sheer extraordinary breadth of the Commonwealth, both culturally and geographically, should be seen as another asset.During the Sixties, when France’s president, Charles de Gaulle, persistently vetoed our application to join the Common Market, he made an oblique reference to the Commonwealth in declaring that Britain was ‘insular, maritime and linked by her exchanges, her markets and her supply routes to the most diverse and often farthest-flung of nations’.But what de Gaulle saw as negatives are now regarded as virtues. We live in an age that eagerly celebrates diversity and revels in variety.The Commonwealth is truly the embodiment of the progressive, globalised world. That means it is a force for good, not just in economic terms, but also in the promotion of democratic freedoms.There are restrictions on our ability to make free trade and investment agreements with partners such as Australia, India and Canada. Pictured: New DelhiThanks to its roots in the British Empire, the Commonwealth Charter places strong emphasis on respect for personal liberty, representative governance, human rights and freedom of expression.It is no coincidence that so many Commonwealth nations have adopted the parliamentary model, given that Britain is the ‘Mother of Parliaments’, just as Magna Carta challenged authoritarian rule and arbitrary imprisonment.Sadly, Britain’s membership of the EU has been a barrier towards closer links with the Commonwealth. There are restrictions on our ability to make free trade and investment agreements with partners such as Australia, India and Canada, while we have also made it difficult for Commonwealth entrepreneurs and skilled staff to come to Britain.It is now a constant complaint from our Commonwealth partners that work visas in the UK are tortuous, if not impossible, to obtain, whereas citizens of the European Union, regardless of their employment records, can enter the UK, thanks to EU rules on free movement.Even so, whatever the outcome of the vote next week and our relationship with the EU, there is a great deal more that Britain could do to strengthen its ties with the Commonwealth. After all, the expansion of trade does not depend on trade deals, no matter how much campaigners bang on about them in the current referendum debate.It is no exaggeration to say that most Britons would have much more in common with people from Australia or India than those from EU nations such as Latvia and Slovakia. Pictured: Riga, the Latvian capitalThe U.S. is Britain’s biggest export market, worth £3.5 billion, yet we have never had a trade agreement with America.What is needed is a change of official attitude, one that recognises what the Commonwealth has to offer. The Government has made strides in that direction.We should not be embarrassed to lead the Commonwealth and invest in the institution. A strong and prosperous Commonwealth would be good for our country and the wider world.How better to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday than by committing greater support to this institution she has done so much to cherish. 

Defiant Corbyn refuses to resign and claims he wants to be Prime Minister despite having a vote of no confidence tabled against him by his own MPs 2016-6-24Jeremy Corbyn has brushed aside calls to quit tonight defiantly saying: 'I will not resign'.Furious Labour MPs said Mr Corbyn 'had to take his share of responsibility' for the referendum result, which saw huge numbers of voters in traditional Labour heartlands back Brexit.Party grandee Dame Margaret Hodge and backbencher Ann Coffey today tabled a formal motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, saying it was time for him to go.But the Labour leader insisted he was the right man to lead the party, telling Channel Four News: 'Of course I want to lead this party in order to put forward an alternative and lead this party to win the election as soon as it comes'. Jeremy Corbyn (pictured walking back to his office holding notes after attending a shadow cabinet meeting today) could be ousted as Labour leader within days The Labour leader insisted was not resigning despite a motion of no confidence being tabled by MPsHe said: 'I'm carrying on. I'm making the case for unity, I'm making the case of what Labour can offer to Britain, of decent housing for people, of good secure jobs for people, of trade with Europe and of course with other parts of the world. 'Because if we don't get the trade issue right we've got a real problem in this country.' He added: 'What the British people need now is stability. Stability to retain their jobs, stability to protect those working conditions, and we need a plan from this government now on how they're going to approach the negotiations for leaving the European Union before they invoke Article 50.'When asked about the vote of no confidence, he said: 'Margaret is obviously entitled to do what she wishes to do. I would ask her to think for a moment, a Tory prime minister resigned, Britain's voted to leave the European Union, there are massive political issues to be addressed.'Is it really a good idea to start a big debate in the Labour Party when I was elected less than a year ago with a very large mandate not from MPs, I fully concede and understand that, but from the party members as a whole.' Mr Corbyn, a lifelong Eurosceptic, only agreed to back the Remain camp after he was threatened with a shadow cabinet walkout last year. But he struggled to make a convincing case to Labour voters, admitting he was 'no lover of the EU'.  Calls for Mr Corbyn to follow the Prime Minister and fall on his sword have grown louder after as many as half of Labour voters abandoned the political mainstream to support the Leave campaign.  Dame Margaret Hodge, pictured attacking Mr Corbyn on Sky News earlier today, has tabled a motion of no confidence in the Labour leaderMPs will vote on the motion next week in a secret ballot. Mr Corbyn has never had significant support among Labour MPs and would be likely to lose a secret vote.The Labour leader has faced repeated accusations he ran a limp, half-hearted campaign for Remain hampered by his long-held Euroscepticism. Dame Margaret today told Sky News: 'I have thought about this overnight, I reflected really deeply.'I think this is for the sake of the nation and the party in the context of a secret ballot, I think there will be overwhelming support.'Labour needs to be able to lead the nation through a period of tumultuous change.' An anonymous Labour MP put it more bluntly, telling the Evening Standard: 'He is toast. If we got into a general election with him as leader, we will be wiped out. The Shadow Cabinet has got to tell him to go.'  Parliamentary Labour Party chairman John Cryer will be asked to accept the motion on Monday night. If he does so, the secret ballot of confidence in Mr Corbyn would be held on Tuesday.While not binding a defeat - which appears inevitable - would be devastating to what little authority Mr Corbyn wields over his MPs.  Jeremy Corbyn, pictured today leaving home, was deserted by thousands of Labour supporters but the party still tried to claim today he was best placed to speak for a divided BritainMr Corbyn faced repeated claims he had run a lacklustre campaign. On the final day he appeared with (from left) Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan The Labour leadership sent out a script to Labour MPs which contained an eight-point plan on how to defend Jeremy Corbyn's performance during the referendumA leaked memo was sent to Labour MPs with scripted lines to take boasting about how well Jeremy Corbyn had performed during the botched EU referendum campaign. In a detailed document for Labour spokespeople going on air to use - obtained by MailOnline - the party claims leadership claims the result is a 'damning indictment' of the Government and defend the desertion of Labour voters as a protest against the Tories.Remarkably, the script gave eight bullet points under the heading: 'What's Jeremy done in this campaign'. It says he has attended 10 EU rallies, met with nurses in Birmingham, a clean beaches event in Truro, launched the Labour In bus and the Ad Van, taken part in a debate on Sky News, written two op-eds, reached more than 10 million people on social media, made six statements to the House of Commons on the EU, dedicated 10 PMQs on Europe and has been 'consistent on this issue from day one of his leadership'. The lengthy document - nearly 2,000 words long - signals the degree of panic at the heart of the Labour leadership over Mr Corbyn's future. He was repeatedly blamed throughout the campaign for failing to send a clear enough message on Labour's stance on the referendum and many in the party are blaming him for the crushing Brexit defeat. It has fuelled speculation that Mr Corbyn privately did not fully support staying in the EU. The lifelong Eurosceptic voted No in the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should stay in the Common Market and admitted as recently as Monday that he was 'not a lover' of the EU and said Brussels must change 'dramatically'. And he also admitted during the campaign that his passion for staying in the EU only rates at 'seven or seven and a half' out of ten. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair led attacks on Mr Corbyn's campaign in the aftermath of the declaration. He said Mr Corbyn had been 'pretty lukewarm' about staying in the EU.He said Labour faced massive questions about its future, adding: 'I think what we will learn in the days, weeks, months ahead, I'm afraid, you can ride the anger through these populist movements but you don't actually produce the answers to the challenges people face.'Asked if Mr Corbyn should quit, Mr Blair said: 'I think there are much, much bigger questions for the Labour Party right now.'We've got to consider what our purpose is, where we are going and what we are trying to do here.'His former spin chief Alastair Campbell said: 'I don't think there is anyone who can seriously think that Jeremy Corbyn connected with these voters that we lost.' Former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw called for him to quit, saying: 'This was a devastating and catastrophic defeat, not just for the Labour party but for our Labour leadership. I think Jeremy is a decent and nice man but his leadership, or rather lack of it, particularly during the referendum campaign, has been abysmal. 'And I do think that, like David Cameron, he needs to shoulder his share of the responsibility and for the sake of the party and the country, step down.' Pro-EU MP Simon Danczuk, who had his Labour whip suspended last year, said there is 'no doubt' that Mr Corbyn must go.Mr Corbyn today answered 'No' when asked if he would resign.Mr Danczuk told Sky News: 'We've failed to get the message across to what you might describe as Labour heartlands.'The truth is that Jeremy Corbyn just doesn't communicate well with those core voters. And the important point from that is that I think they're actually making that final disconnect with Labour.'They weren't happy under Ed Miliband's leadership but they put up with it. They're not happy with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.'Their final act of disconnection is that they've gone and voted to take us out of Europe and that's what we're seeing this morning in these results.'Asked if it means a change of leadership, he said: 'There's no doubt about it. You can't carry on, if you can't communicate with your core voters then you're not going to win general elections.' Brexit-backing Labour MP John Mann was scathing in his response, saying working class voters are 'sick to death' with what they are being offered.He told BBC News: 'Labour has gone wrong by not being in touch with its voters, I've been saying this for the last 10 years in relation to immigration and free movement of labour, I've been saying it in relation to what the offer is to working class people - it's not something new in this campaign, I'm not the only one, but it's a small number who have been saying it at the national level in Labour.'I've said it for the last 10 years repeatedly and what we're offering working class people, what the country's offering, is zero hours contracts, agency work, insecurity, and people are sick to death of it, they've had enough.'And that's why in my area and elsewhere Labour voters have voted in huge numbers to leave the European Union.'Simon Danczuk, pictured today at the national referendum count in Manchester, was the among the first Labour voices to call for Mr Corbyn to resign over the referendum result Until the Lisbon Treaty was signed, the EU had no formal legal process for members to leave.But when member states were negotiating the 2007 agreement – which came into force two years later – they inserted Article 50.This spells out the process by which governments can give the EU notice of their intention to leave the bloc.Activating Article 50 fires the starting gun on a two-year negotiation, after which the member state automatically ceases to be in the EU.Any new deal on membership terms must be signed off by a two-thirds majority of the European Council and be approved by the European Parliament.The deadline can only be extended by a unanimous vote of the Council members.Shadow minister Jon Ashworth said Labour must 'get out of London' and understand why Northern towns have voted to leave the European Union.He told Sky News said: 'We have to understand why people voted the way they did. I've been arguing that we in the Labour Party, all the way down from the shadow cabinet, we'll be having our shadow cabinet meeting tomorrow, I'll be saying one of things we've got to do is get out of London and go to Sunderland, to Middlesbrough, to Wigan, and find out why people voted the way they did.'Former Cabinet minister Yvette Cooper said Labour must address concerns in industrial towns and former coalfield communities.Ms Cooper told ITV News: 'I think it does show really the pattern of a divided country and that is going to be a challenge for us whatever the result is, a real task to pull the country back together again.'We have got particularly division between the cities and the towns, we knew that the Tory shires were more likely to be voting to Leave, the cities more likely to be voting Remain, we've also known for some time that industrial towns and coalfield communities were more likely to be voting to Leave as well.'I think recognising the divisions and the genuine concerns of people who are voting out because they are in envy about the lack of economic opportunities, feeling worried about immigration, those sorts of concerns, that I think the Government has not listened to and not responded to and all parties need to respond to as well.' Labour MP Graham Jones said: 'I want a damn good explanation from Jeremy Corbyn as to why we ended up in this mess. If I am not satisfied, I will support the motion.' A key member of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign told HuffPostUK: 'Jeremy hasn't pulled his weight. Even if we had won, it would have been despite not because of him.' Piers Corbyn, the Labour leader's brother, suggested Mr Corbyn retained his Eurosceptic views and could have backed Brexit in the privacy of the polling booth Mr Corbyn was dogged throughout the referendum campaign by claims he was failing to effectively make the case for staying in the EU.Even his brother, Piers Corbyn, said the Labour leader could back Brexit in the privacy of the polling booth.Nigel Farage today laid claim to the 'old Labour' vote, using a speech in Westminster to herald Ukip's success in winning over working class communities. Labour MPs who were already furious with Mr Corbyn will seize upon suggestions Mr Corbyn could capitalise on Brexit as further evidence the veteran left winger is deeply out of touch.  Mr Corbyn himself today demanded Mr Cameron outline measures to stabilise the economy and invoke Article 50 of the EU Treaty - which begins Britain's departure - immediately in line with the nation's wishes before focusing on his own future. 

'Death to traitors, freedom for Britain': For a nation utterly sickened by the death of Jo Cox, a revolting new low as suspect utters chilling words in court2016-6-18It seemed impossible anything could cause more shock and outrage than the brutal killing of Labour MP Jo Cox… until the nine chilling words uttered in open court yesterday by the man accused of murdering her.Asked to give his name, Thomas Mair stunned the courtroom by declaring: ‘My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.’Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot was so taken aback, she asked Mair to repeat his reply.Thomas Mair, depicted centre, told Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday: 'My name is death to traitors' Mair was charged with the murder of MP Jo Cox, pictured, who was shot and stabbed on Thursday afternoonMair was dressed in a grey sweatshirt and tracksuit bottoms during yesterday's 30-minute hearing Dressed in a grey sweatshirt and tracksuit trousers, stocky Mair, who also sported a small grey beard, repeated the same carefully rehearsed nine words, calmly and with no sign of emotion.Asked a third time if that was the name he intended to give to the court, he replied: ‘Yes.’During the rest of his 30-minute appearance in the glass-fronted dock of Court One at a preliminary hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Mair, 52, was silent.By the time he was led away, flanked by black-shirted guards, the court had heard the first outline of his alleged crime.As he shot defenceless Batley and Spen MP Mrs Cox, Mair shouted, ‘Keep Britain independent’ and ‘Britain First’.When he was arrested he said he was a ‘political activist’, and police have found articles about Mrs Cox at his home, along with ‘extreme Right-wing and white supremacist’ material.Mair was remanded in custody to reappear at the Old Bailey tomorrow for a bail application Mair’s court appearance came amid further dramatic political developments concerning the death of Mrs Cox, the activities of other far-Right extremists, and Thursday’s EU referendum:Furthermore, this newspaper has uncovered fresh evidence of far-Right involvement in the referendum campaign – with appalling social media slurs against 41-year-old Mrs Cox.A racist South African-inspired group linked to Mair has urged its supporters to campaign for a Leave vote on Thursday.There were emotional scenes yesterday when Mrs Cox’s younger sister, Kim Leadbeater, paid tribute to the late MP as an ‘utterly amazing woman’.She and her parents visited the scene of Mrs Cox’s death, while the MP’s grieving husband Brendan looked after their two young children.Thomas Mair, pictured, is said to have suffered from mental health problems Family members are expected to be in the Commons public gallery tomorrow when Parliament is recalled so that MPs can pay tributes to Mrs Cox. A flower-laden memorial will be towed along the Thames from the houseboat where Mrs Cox lived to Westminster on Wednesday, which would have been her birthday. An online fundraising page launched after her death has already raised more than £500,000.A three-day suspension in the EU referendum campaign ordered after the tragedy will be lifted today. However, both the Leave and Remain camps have vowed to tone down their aggressive rheto-ric following claims that it has contributed to a volatile public mood in the run-up to Thursday’s momentous vote.Mair arrived in court yesterday – he appeared in London as a result of the high-profile nature of the case – just after 10am, flanked by two guards.He was handcuffed to one of them but the restraints were removed after the court heard there had been no application to keep them on.Friends and relatives of the murdered MP gathered in Birstall, West Yorkshire, for a brief commemoration Ms Cox's parents Jean and Gordon Leadbeater, pictured, held hands as they remembered their daughterKim Leadbeater, pictured reading from a sheet of paper, addressed the crowd in Birstall yesterday Jobbing gardener Mair, who is said to have suffered from mental health problems, appeared alert as he looked around the courtroom.After declaring his name as ‘death to traitors, freedom for Britain’ he fell silent and did not answer when asked his address or date of birth. Instead, he stared straight ahead. He was also accused of committing grievous bodily harm against Bernard Kenny, the pensioner who tried to save Mrs Cox, and possession of a gun with intent to commit murder and possession of a knife.Prosecuting barrister David Cawthorne then read out the full charges against Mair before giving the first full account of his alleged crimes, including their allegedly political motivation.He revealed that married mother- of-two Mrs Cox had spent Thursday morning visiting a school and a care home in her West Yorkshire constituency before travelling to a planned surgery for local residents in Birstall library.At about 12.45pm, the MP was spotted as she got out of her car by 77-year-old Mr Kenny, who was waiting for his wife while she visited the library.‘Almost immediately he saw she was approached by an unknown male who began to attack her with a knife,’ the court was told.Mr Kenny instinctively rushed to help but the knifeman stabbed him in the abdomen, forcing him to ‘retreat’ to a nearby sandwich shop. He remains in hospital.Mair was remanded in custody to Belmarsh high security prison in south east London, picturedWestminster Magistrates' Court heard the assailant was seen to stab Ms Cox, pictured, repeatedly The assailant was then seen to stab Mrs Cox ‘repeatedly’ and when she fell to the ground he was said to have taken a firearm from a black holdall and shot her three times. He then continued to stab her as she lay fighting for her life, the court heard.Mr Cawthorne said: ‘Whilst doing that the defendant was heard to say words to the effect of “Britain first, keep Britain independent, Britain always comes first, this is for Britain”.’ Mair was said to have left the scene ‘calmly’ while Mrs Cox was rushed to hospital.She she was pronounced dead at 1.48pm. A post-mortem examination found the cause of death was multiple stab and gunshot wounds.Two policemen spotted Mair walking through Birstall carrying a black holdall and wearing a black baseball cap. They ordered him to drop the bag, and he stood in the road with his hands out and said: ‘It’s me.’The officers rugby-tackled him to the floor to handcuff him, and while they were searching him he allegedly stated: ‘I’m a political activist.’In his trouser pockets, it is alleged, they found a plastic bag full of .22mm bullets, while in the black bag they found a single-barrelled modified rifle with the safety cap off, one round in the chamber and two more in the magazine.There was also a blood-stained mobile phone, a black baseball cap with the logo ‘Cuvana rum flavoured beer’, a blood-stained ‘dagger knife’ and a black wallet containing Mair’s photo ID, the court was told.After Mair was arrested and armed police secured the area, his home in Birstall was searched.According to the case summary provided to the court by the Crown Prosecution Service’s counter-terror division: ‘Initial searches have recovered newspaper articles relating to Jo Cox and ideological material relating to extreme Right-wing and white supremacist organisations / individuals.’ The court was told that Mair had applied for legal aid and will appear before the Old Bailey tomorrow for a bail application, and that a later hearing in his case could be heard along with terrorism cases.In the meantime he is being held at Belmarsh top-security jail in South-East London.Ms Arbuthnot observed that Mair’s mental health should be assessed in the light of his courtroom outburst. ‘Bearing in mind the name he has just given, he ought to be seen by a psychiatrist,’ she said. 

It all ends in tears: David Cameron stands down in the wake of historic Brexit vote with emotional resignation speech as rival Boris Johnson makes first pitch to take over 2016-6-23While the country reflects on one of the most seismic political events Britain has experienced in peacetime, David Cameron closes the day knowing his time as Prime Minister is set to come to a dramatic end. The sun sets on a day in politics which had begun with Mr Cameron flanked by his wife Samantha in Downing Street as both fought back tears and he spoke of how he had been 'proud' to serve as PM for the past six years.Mr Cameron said it would not be right for him to be the 'captain of the ship' while the UK negotiated its exit from the EU.And as voters changed the course of history, one of those who reigned victorious was former London Mayor Boris Johnson, who set out his claim that Britain now had an opportunity to re-establish itself on the world stage - and consequently made a pitch to be Prime Minister of a new 'great' Britain outside the EU. Boris Johnson set out his vision for a revitalised, outward looking country in a speech just hours after his long-time rival tearfully declared that he would stand aside in the wake of the referendum Brexit vote.But it immediately became clear that whoever is in Downing Street will face a struggle to hold the UK together - as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon warned it was now 'highly likely' that a second ballot on independence will be held north of the border. Scroll down for video Embrace: After the Prime Minister said that the UK needed a new leader he clasped hands with his wife - who was too emotional to return his smile after the devastating Brexit defeatEmotional: Mrs Cameron clearly had tears in her eyes as her husband resigned - Mr Cameron himself struggled to get through his speechBoris Johnson stopped short of confirming that he would stand to succeed David Cameron today - but made a broad appeal to people stay calm and help forge a better futureThe developments came after the Leave campaign stacked up 52 per cent of the votes - despite massive support for Remain in Scotland and major cities including London.The Bank of England governor Mark Carney has attempted to reassure panicking markets this morning after the Pound nose-dived to its lowest level against the US dollar for 31 years, and the FTSE slumped by 8 per cent. The index closed just 2.7 per cent down, as it recovered. After his speech, Mr Cameron travelled to Buckingham Palace to discuss the results with the Queen. Boris Johnson thanked voters for trusting his plan to leave the EU today and sought to reassure young Remain voters by saying we will be no less European despite cutting ties with Brussels.He insisted there was no need for 'haste' in the process of officially withdrawing from the EU as he appealed for calm and sought to reassure fears over economic and political uncertainty.After the EU referendum results delivered a shock win for Brexit in the early hours of this morning, Mr Johnson said the EU was 'a noble idea for its time' but was 'not longer right for this country'.Brussels was 'too remote, too opaque and not not accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve,' the former Mayor of London added as he hailed the 'glorious opportunity' that quitting the EU gave the UK. President Barack Obama said the UK  will remain an 'indispensable partner' of the United States following the Brexit vote in the referendum - even though he intervened in the campaign to say voting to leave would leave Britain at the 'back of the queue' for a trade deal.Mr Obama said: 'The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom's membership in Nato remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security and economic policy.'So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond.'The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.'The bombshell announcement came after possibly the most dramatic night Britain has experienced in peacetime. Among the biggest developments are:Mr Johnson, who was booed and called a 'tw*t' by protesters as he left his home in central London this morning, started off his statement at the Vote Leave HQ in central London by paying tribute to his 'extraordinary' Tory colleague Mr Cameron.The former London mayor stopped short of confirming that he would stand to succeed the PM - but made a pitch for people to help him forge a better future.He also sought to soothe fears over the financial market panic that has greeted the historic result, stressing that nothing would change in the short term. 'I want to begin by paying tribute to David Cameron who has spoken earlier form Downing Street. I know I speak for Michael when I say how sad I am he has decided to step down but obviously I respect that decision,' Mr Johnson said.'I have known David Cameron for a very long time and I believe he has been one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age.'A brave and principled man whose given superb leadership of his party and his country for many years – reforming our public services, delivering one nation Conservative government, making this country the most dynamic economy in Europe and with his own brand of compassionate Conservatism that rightly earned him the first majority government for decades.'David Cameron said he could not be the 'captain of the ship' while the UK negotiated its exit from the EU as he announced he would be resigning as Prime Minister and Tory leader David and Samantha Cameron comforted each other after he made his emotional statement outside the famous door of 10 Downing StreetMr Cameron (left) said he accepted the verdict of the 'great democratic exercise' which saw the Leave campaign triumph. His wife Samantha appeared to be getting emotional as her husband announced that he would stand down in October The FTSE 100 rallied today and closed just 2.7 per cent down after more than £100billion was wiped out by panicked traders when Brexit was confirmed.The London stock market has returned to the levels of last week despite dropping by seven per cent - around 450 points - when it opened this morning.The UK's banks were the hardest hit with RBS shares down 34 per cent, Lloyds down 28 per cent and Barclays down 30 per cent as the markets opened.  London's top flight index had lost more than £100billion earlier in the session, while world markets descended into chaos as uncertainty spread across the globe.  Within minutes Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said would inject up to £250billion into the economy to steady the ship and the FTSE moved gradually upwards.By 4,30pm £45billion had been wiped off the value of the UK's biggest companies and roughly 280 points had been restored. Brexiters had predicted  a sharp devaluation of the pound at the FTSE 100 was inevitable if they won, but argued that this would be healthy and boost exports.Defending the Tory policy of holding the referendum, Mr Johnson said: 'The rights of all of us to elect and remove the people who make the key decisions in their lives. I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can.'They have decided it is time to vote to take back control.' Mr Johnson said: 'In voting to leave the EU it is vital to stress there is now no need for haste and, indeed, as the Prime minister has just said, nothing will change over the short term except that work will have to begin on how to give effect to the will of the people and to extricate this country from the supranational system.'He also stressed that the PM had been 'right' to say he would not immediately trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the formal mechanism for leaving the EU.  'To those who may be anxious, whether at home or abroad this does not mean the United Kingdom will be in any way less united. Nor, indeed, does it mean it will be any less European,' Mr Johnson said.'I want to speak directly to the millions of people who did not vote for this outcome, especially young people, who may feel this decision in some way involves pulling up a draw bridge or any kind of isolationism.'I think the very opposite is true. We cannot turn our backs of Europe, we are part of Europe. Our children and our grandchildren will have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling to the continent, understanding the languages, and cultures that make up our common European civilisation.'Mr Johnson said he believed the country now had a 'glorious opportunity'.  'We can pass our laws, set our taxes, entirely according to the needs of the UK economy,' he said.'We can control our own borders, in a way that is not discriminatory but fair, and balanced and take the wind out of the sales of the extremists and those who would play politics of immigration.'Above all, we can find our voice in the world again. A voice that is commensurate with the fifth biggest economy on earth – powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary force for good in the world.'And the most precious thing this country has given the continent is the idea of parliamentary democracy.' Choking back tears, Mr Cameron - who led the Tories to a shock majority in the general election barely a year ago - said he would not depart immediately and would seek to 'steady the ship' and calm the financial markets over the coming 'weeks and months'.But he said a new Prime Minister should be in place for the Conservative Party conference at the beginning of October. 'I held nothing back. I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the EU,' he said.'And I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone – not the future of any single politician including myself.'But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.'  Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

And I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my cabinet for the next three months.'Tony Blair said Brexit made him 'sad for our country, for Europe, for the world' as he also hit out at Jeremy Corbyn's Labour campaign todayMr Cameron said he had spoken to the Queen this morning to alert her to his decision. He also said he would not be triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty but would instead leave it to his successor.'The negotiation with the EU will need to begin under a new Prime Minister and I think it is right this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU,' Mr Cameron said. 'The British people have made a choice that not only needs to be respected but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.'Britain is a special country, we have so many great advantages – a Parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate.'A great trading nation with our science and arts, our engineering and creativity, respected the world over.'And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multi racial, multi faith democracy where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest their talent allows.'He went on: 'Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I have said before Britain can survive outside the EU and indeed that we could find a way.'Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way. I will do everything I can to help.'I love this country, and I feel honoured to have served it and I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed.'No10 officials are said to have tried to persuade Mr Cameron to stay on beyond the party conference in October. Pro-Brexit MPs argued that, if the PM removed George Osborne as Chancellor, there would be no successful challenge to his position.But one pro-Brexit minister accused Mr Cameron of pursuing a ‘scorched earth’ policy designed to wreck chances of making a success of withdrawal, adding: ‘He repeatedly said he would deliver the verdict of the British people, whatever it was, and instead he has decided to cut and run. Another minister said they did not think it was possible for Mr Cameron to cling on for so many months without appointing a team to negotiate new terms with the EU. Mr Johnson described the PM as ‘one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age’.‘It was his bravery that gave this country the first referendum on the European Union for 43 years,’ he added. Former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said: ‘I think it’s very sad that David has decided he has to go. I think he made the right decision.’Moments after Mr Cameron finished speaking, Mr Carney made a televised statement from the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street urging calm.He said it was 'inevitable' there would be a period of 'uncertainty' in the wake of the Brexit vote, and admitted it would take 'some time' for the UK to forge new arrangements with the EU and the rest of the world.But the governor - who previously warned that Brexit was the biggest domestic risk to the economy - insisted the Bank and the Treasury had been doing 'extensive emergency planning'.'We are well prepared for this,' he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her 'great regret' after David Cameron's push for a Remain vote in the EU referendum failed. French President Francois Hollande said the UK's vote to leave the EU must act as a 'jolt' to the bloc to implement the 'profound change' needed to address its troublesEgoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

But there is no point in hiding it - for me this a very, very sad day.'He blasted Labour's Remain campaign, saying Mr Corbyn and his followers had not set out the 'enormous consequences' of quitting the EU.Asked if the party's leader should resign, Mr Blair said: 'I think there are much, much bigger questions for the Labour Party right now. We've got to consider what our purpose is, where we are going and what we are trying to do here.'A joint statement issued by EU leaders today expressed 'regret' over the UK's decision. But they promised to respect the British people's decision and called for negotiations to be launched 'swiftly'.French President François Hollande said he wanted the UK to start talks over its exit package negotiations 'as soon as possible', while German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her 'great regret'.The EU's joint statement said: 'In a free and democratic process, the British people have expressed their wish to leave the European Union. We regret this decision but respect it.'This is an unprecedented situation but we are united in our response. We will stand strong and uphold the EU's core values of promoting peace and the well-being of its peoples.'The Union of 27 Member States will continue. The Union is the framework of our common political future.'We are bound together by history, geography and common interests and will develop our cooperation on this basis.'Together we will address our common challenges to generate growth, increase prosperity and ensure a safe and secure environment for our citizens. The institutions will play their full role in this endeavour.'We now expect the United Kingdom government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be. Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty.'Eurosceptic parties across the continent are intensifying demands for their own referendums in the wake of the Brexit vote, as the repercussions of the political earthquake gradually become clear.Shortly after the result was announced, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National in France, called for a 'Frexit' vote on Twitter, while the far-Right Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders called for a 'Nexit'.In Italy the leader of the Italian anti-immigrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, called the European Union 'a cage of crazies' that is killing jobs and citizen dignity.And there are also fears that Brexit could also trigger a Czexit, a Swexit, and a Grexit in the Czech Republic, Sweden andGreece. Even if the union holds, the political earthquake that has erupted in Britain will have far-reaching aftershocks. DAVID WILLIAM DONALD CAMERON ALEXANDER BORIS DE PFEFFEL JOHNSONAge: 49Educated: Eton College Brasenose College, OxfordDegree: Politics, Philosophy and EconomicsUniversity drinking society: Bullingdon Club Height: 6ft 1in Constituency: Witney Big jobs: Prime Minister Adviser to Norman Lamont in the Treasury during 1980sMemorable moment: Leading the Conservatives to a surprise overall majority at the general election last year Hobbies: Tennis (beats Boris), 'chlilaxing' at Chequers country retreat Age: 52Educated: Eton College Balliol College, OxfordDegree: ClassicsUniversity drinking society: Bullingdon Club  Height: 5ft 9inConstituency: Uxbridge and South RuislipBig jobs: Mayor of LondonBrussels correspondent for the Daily TelegraphMemorable moment: Getting stuck on a zip wire while carrying union jack flags during the 2012 Olympics Hobbies: Tennis (loses to Dave), singing Beethoven Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

But on the day Britain backed Brexit is anything impossible? THERESA MAYAfter six years as Home Secretary, Theresa May is the sober, serious choice - and probably the strongest 'continuity candidate' who could succeed Cameron.May has become the longest serving Home Secretary, thriving in a brief which has proved the graveyard for many a political career. Tough, a safe pair of hands and widely respected - if not always seen fondly - May could be the anti-Boris.STEPHEN CRABBPerhaps the biggest unknown in the race, the work and pensions secretary was parachuted into the top of front line politics as the replacement for Iain Duncan Smith after his bombshell resignation over the Budget.Crabb, a Welsh son of a broken home, could be the leading One Nation candidate in the leadership race.Being a new name - and one who was quiet in the referendum - could allow Crabb to define himself a unifying candidate. LIAM FOX A heavy weight with Cabinet experience, Fox has run for the leadership before - and lost.But he is extremely popular on the right of the party and played a leading role in referendum campaign, appearing with different parts of the Leave movement.The former defence secretary is known to have a war chest ready and waiting for the leadership campaign and is well connected on the Tory benches.While it is perhaps hard to see a route onto the final shortlist, Fox would undoubtedly be well organised and a fearsome candidate.  Britons are 'chippy, ungrateful to Eastern European immigrants, economically illiterate and sad': Luvvies react to BrexitRichard Bacon today blasted people who backed Brexit as 'chippy, inward looking and ungrateful to Eastern European immigrants' as stars had their say on the referendum result.The broadcaster also said that those who voted to leave the EU were also 'economically illiterate' in a series of barbed tweets.Harry Potter creator JK Rowling even said she wished for the magic from her books to go back and change the decision.The author, who lives in Scotland, wrote: 'I don't think I've ever wanted magic more', adding: 'Scotland will seek independence now.

I'm so sorry to the youth of Britain. I fear you've been let down today'.In a play on words BBC star Gary Lineker tweeted: 'U kip for a couple of hours and look what happens. What have we gone and done?'He added later: 'We should maybe change the "Union Jack" to "I'm alright Jack".' Model Alexa Chung tweeted a broken heart emoji while Boy George wrote: 'There's no use crying over spilt milk. We'll just ave (sic) to mek (sic) the best of it!'. Another star to speak out was Niall Horan of boy band One Direction - who was not previously known for his political activism.The 22-year-old singer, who is from Ireland but has been based in Britain since he appeared on The X Factor in 2010, singled out Nigel Farage for criticism as he expressed his upset at the result.'It's a sad day,' Horan wrote on Twitter. 'The economic impact that this is going to have is definitely going to make those voters regret their decision.'And I see Farage is talking c**p and telling lies as per usual on telly. Let's see what he does now. He really is a terrible man.'How can you sway that many people into thinking their health service is going to be funded and when the vote goes your way tell them we shouldn't have said that and it was a mistake? Bulls***.' Messages: James Corden said the youth of Britain has been let down - Gary Lineker cited the influence if Ukip and said: 'What have we gone and done?'  Sentiment: Model Alexa Chung tweeted a simple heartbroken emoji as she joined the long queue of stars to tweet  Singer Lily Allen also took to Twitter to vent her fury and desperation at the result of the Brexit vote.She posted: 'Well Millennials. We're really f*****.' While some celebrities tweeted their despair at the notion of a Brexit, comedians made light of the situation with Ricky Gervais, Hugh Laurie and Frankie Boyle all cracking wise.Remarking on the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, Gervais wrote: 'Relax. Boris Johnson is going to take over now.'While Laurie focused on the effect the Brexit will have on Britons attending Euro 2016, by writing: 'First hairline crack in the plasterwork: England fans will be paying 25 quid for a bottle of beer by Monday.'Scottish stand-up Boyle joked that Britons should look for a new home, he said: 'It's important to accept the result and move on, possibly to a new country.'Rant: One Direction star Niall Horan vented his fury about the Leave campaign on Twitter earlier todayMonthy Python legend Eric Idle remained deadpan and suggested that British Leave voters had made a rod for their own backs.He simply posted: 'UK. Foot. Shot.'Millionaire businessman and Apprentice boss Alan Sugar also tweeted his concern about the Brexit.In particular Lord Sugar spoke of  the financial effects that the country's exit from the EU could have, he wrote: 'I just woke to hear we are out of the EU. Shocked to say the least. I fear for the future. Markets collapsed lets hope temporary.'Artists, actors and musicians including Benedict Cumberbatch and Helena Bonham Carter  signed a 'luvvies' letter' claiming leaving the EU would make Britain ‘less imaginative’. The warning was signed by 250 of Britain's celebrities and says if Britain were to leave the European Union it would become ‘an outsider shouting from the wings’.Gallows humour: Comedians took to Twitter to share their views on the Brexit, with standup Frankie Boyle announcing that it may be time to leave the countryAmong other signatories were the singer Paloma Faith, 50 Shades of Grey director Sam Taylor-Wood, Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, 12 Years a Slave star Chiwetel Ejiofor and The Wire actor Dominic West.Tracey Emin, Steve Coogan, Sir Patrick Stewart, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, Keira Knightley, Jude Law, Eddie Izzard, Bill Nighy, Jenny Agutter and Jessie Ware have also signed.These so-called 'cultural stars' also warned a Brexit vote could undermine the creative arts, pointing out many of them worked on projects supported by EU money.Brexit would also undermine ‘collaborating across borders’ they said in a letter to the Guardian before the vote.'From the smallest gallery to the biggest blockbuster, many of us have worked on projects that would never have happened without vital EU funding or by collaborating across borders,' the letter says.Concern: Lord Alan Sugar tweeted that he was worried about what the future could hold after a BrexitEgoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

The option of a second referendum must be on the table and it is on the table'.Her intervention has also led to calls by Sinn Fein for a vote on Irish unity because Northern Ireland also backed Remain.'It's on the table': Nicola Sturgeon (pictured today) has said she will start work immediately to pave the way for a second Scottish independence referendum All 32 local authorities in Scotland delivered a vote for Remain - Nicola Sturgeon this shows that her country was being pulled out against its will While the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, Scots overwhelmingly opted to remain, with Ms Sturgeon declaring the result meant there had been a 'significant and material change in the circumstances in which Scotland voted against independence' in 2014.She said: 'As things stand, Scotland faces the prospect of being taken out of the EU against our will. I regard that as democratically unacceptable.'Speaking at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, she said: 'I intend to take all possible steps and explore all possible options to give effect to how people in Scotland voted - in other words to secure our continuing place in the EU, and in the single market in particular.'The SNP manifesto for May's Holyrood elections said the Scottish Parliament 'should have the right to hold another referendum if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will'.Ms Sturgeon said: 'It is, therefore, a statement of the obvious that a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.'All 32 local authority areas north of the border returned a majority for Remain in the EU referendum, with the country voting by 62% to 38% in favour of Remain.Ms Sturgeon said: 'Unfortunately, of course, yesterday's result in Scotland was not echoed across the whole of the United Kingdom. The UK-wide vote to leave the EU is one that I deeply regret.'The vote across England and Wales was a rejection of the EU and it was a sign of divergence between Scotland and large parts of the rest of the UK and how we see our place in the rest of the world.'Furious Scottish nationalists had already pounced on today's historic vote to leave the EU by immediately demanding a second referendum on splitting from the UK. The SNP said the UK faces a 'constitutional crisis' after Scotland voted overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU but is on course to cut ties with Brussels after the Leave won the overall UK vote.  All 32 authorities north of the border delivered majority wins for Remain and joined only London and Northern Ireland as areas that did not vote for Brexit. Irish republicans have already used the referendum result to call for the reunification of Ireland.Almost two thirds - 62 per cent - of Scots who voted had backed staying part of the EU, with 38 per cent opting for Brexit. After counting had finished in the early hours of this morning, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland had delivered an 'unequivocal' vote to stay in Europe and said it was 'clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union'. It suggests she is already planning a second independence referendum after the SNP manifesto for the Scottish elections last month said they would demand another vote if there is 'significant and material' change in circumstances, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. The passionate pro-union Harry Potter author JK Rowling angrily hit out at David Cameron, accusing him of putting the future of the UK in jeopardy for calling the referendum in the first place.She wrote: 'Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.'First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (pictured casting her vote yesterday) said Scotland had delivered an 'unequivocal' vote to stay in Europe and said it was 'clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union'This morning Ms Sturgeon's predecessor as First Minister Alex Salmond  said he was 'quite certain' Ms Sturgeon would 'implement the manifesto' because England is 'dragging us out the EU'.He said a second referendum on splitting from the UK should be held within two years so Scotland is not forced out of the EU. The process of withdrawing from Brussels will take up to two years from when the UK Government triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty - which sets out the formal arrangements for leaving. 'From when that starting gun is fired, it's a two-year period,' Mr Salmond said of the withdrawal process. Insisting a second independence referendum was justified, he added: 'So whatever that period is - two years, two-and-a-half years, that would have to be the timescale of the next referendum because what you would want to do is remain in the European Union while the rest of the UK moved out.' Holyrood External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hylsop warned that a decision by the UK to quit Europe would have 'consequences'.She told the BBC: 'Scotland clearly and decisively voted to remain part of the European Union, 62 to 38 with an increased turn out form the Scottish Parliament elections barely six weeks ago.Harry Potter author J.K Rowling angrily hit out at David Cameron this morning, accusing him of putting the future of the union in jeopardy by calling the EU referendum in the first place This morning her predecessor Alex Salmond (right) said he was 'quite certain' Nicola Sturgeon (left) would 'implement the manifesto' because England is 'dragging us out the EU'Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

Their interests are about maintaining that membership, they are interested in maintaining our relations with Europe. We have to find the means with which we can do that.'While she said there is 'some way to go in determining the mechanism of doing that', she said: 'Decisions have consequences and if the United Kingdom has made a decision against the interests of the Scottish people that will have consequences.' After all the results north of the border were declared, Ms Sturgeon said: 'Scotland has delivered a strong, unequivocal vote to remain in the EU, and I welcome that endorsement of our European status.'And while the overall result remains to be declared, the vote here makes clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union.'She added: 'Scotland has contributed significantly to the Remain vote across the UK. That reflects the positive campaign the SNP fought, which highlighted the gains and benefits of our EU membership, and people across Scotland have responded to that positive message.'We await the final UK-wide result, but Scotland has spoken - and spoken decisively.'A furious Mr Salmond told the BBC: 'Scotland looks like it is going to vote solidly Remain. If there was a Leave vote in England, dragging us out the EU, I'm quite certain Nicola Sturgeon would implement the SNP manifesto.' The Brexit battle turned in Sunderland overnight as a huge win for the Leave campaign signaled the referendum would not end as expected.Remain was handed four and six point leads in on-the-day opinion polls after the final ballots were closed. The results were so striking, Ukip leader Nigel Farage effectively conceded the referendum. But a shock result in Sunderland which saw the Out camp win by 61 per cent to 39 per cent. Analysis before the referendum had suggested Leave could be on track to win if they were more than six percentage points ahead.A surprise victory for Brexit in Swansea, where the pro-EU side had been expecting to romp home, signposted a disastrous showing for Remain across Wales. Areas like Carmarthenshire decisively turned their back on Brussels.Newcastle was less clear cut for the pro-EU side than they had hoped, seeing them sneak home by just 51 per cent to 49 per cent. Remain had some bright spots, with chunky wins in London, Scotland and Oxford. Wandsworth in particular piled in with a massive 77 per cent in favour of staying.However, the big English cities and Scotland were not enough to offset the will of the rest of the country, and Leave passed the finishing post at 6am.Speaking at a jubilant Leave.EU rally in central London, Mr Farage said June 23 would go down in history as 'our independence day'.In a remark that could prove controversial after Labour MP Jo Cox was shot dead last week, Mr Farage said the country was separating from the EU 'without a single bullet being fired' . 'Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,' he said.'This, if the predictions now are right, this will be a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.'We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption and deceit.Egoin installs 'collective custom build' property in EdinburghCruel moment man dumps his dog at the roadside before driving offPolice chief speculates there may not have been a drone at allTeenage Meghan put on scene-stealing performance at Christmas showBye Felicia!

That reflects the positive campaign the SNP fought, which highlighted the gains and benefits of our EU membership, and people across Scotland have responded to that positive message.'We await the final UK-wide result, but Scotland has spoken - and spoken decisively.'Former first minister Alex Salmond said the ballot should take place within the next two years while negotiations were still ongoing about the UK's exit, so that Scotland could break away from Britain before it left the bloc.    Former Europe minister and Labour MP Keith Vaz told the BBC the outcome was a 'catastrophe'. 'Frankly, in a thousand years I would never have believed that the British people would have voted this way,' he said.'And they have done so and I think that they voted emotionally rather than looking at the facts.'It'll be catastrophic for our country, for the rest of Europe and indeed the world.'He added: 'The issues of immigration are extremely important, if you look at the campaign I think that there needed to be a much stronger campaign to stay in.'Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the Conservative Party was 'utterly preoccupied with leadership infighting rather than the future of the country', adding: 'This letter cannot unsay what senior Tory politicians have been telling us for weeks - that the British people simply cannot trust David Cameron.' The atmosphere at the Leave.EU campaign party in London is jubilant as voters in the early stages give them a larger lead than expected and they win key battlegroundsMore people enjoy the party at the Leave.EU base in Westminster where people look as though they are beginning to think they may even win the referendum voteLib Dem former Cabinet minister Sir Vince Cable said Mr Cameron's authority would be 'completely gone' in the event of the Leave win.He described holding the referendum as a 'very bad call' by the Prime Minister, who failed to understand what happens 'when you just throw the cards in the air'. But senior Tories rallied round in an effort to protect the PM. Cabinet minister Chris Grayling - a Brexit backer - said: 'It would be an absolute nonsense if David Cameron felt, having given the country that choice, if they take the decision he couldn't carry on the job. We are completely behind him staying, we want him to stay and that letter is a statement of commitment to his leadership.'Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's hard-right Front National, hailed the referendum result as a 'victory for liberty' on TwitterBefore Mr Cameron's announcement, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb said he did not think the Prime Minister 'could have done any more' and it was 'absolutely essential' that he remains in No 10.He said: 'There isn't anybody else around the Cabinet table or outside the Cabinet, for that matter, or in any of the other political parties who can give this country the kind of leadership skills and abilities that David Cameron can at this, what is going to be very challenging weeks and months for the country.'He added: 'I just think there is a disconnect with the white working class. We didn't get our core messages across to them.'When we tried to explain to them just how important the European Single Market was to their jobs, their livelihoods, we didn't quite land those messages successfully.'And I think that is one of the themes that is emerging this evening is that old industrial white working class areas clearly haven't bought the message that we have tried hard to communicate.'In those areas which are strongly perhaps white working class there will be a strong vote for Out and that's something as a Government we need to respond to.'Clearly, I think one of the features of this referendum are some of those social divisions and clearly as a Government, as a political class, all parties, we need to show that we're responding to that.' Nigel Farage looked somber as he conceded defeat at around 11pm, admitting that Remain may edge the victory, but he looked overjoyed after a series of results that were better than expected for the campaign at 12.30amRemain campaigners celebrated as the result came in for Gibraltar which voted In overwhelmingly. But it was downhill after that as Out won key battlegroundsOn the counting floor in Sunderland, there are scenes of joy as the huge win is announced, which will send ripples of hope to their fellow Brexit voters across the country Pro-Brexit former defence secretary Liam Fox called for a 'period of calm' and urged the Government not to invoke article 50 straight away while insisting Mr Cameron must stay on as PM.Dr Fox told BBC News: 'A lot of things were said in advance of this referendum that we might want to think about again and that (invoking article 50) is one of them.'I think that it doesn't make any sense to trigger article 50 without having a period of reflection first, for the Cabinet to determine exactly what it is that we're going to be seeking and in what timescale.'And then you have to also consider what is happening with the French elections and the German elections next year and the implications that that might have for them.'So a period of calm, a period of reflection, to let it all sink in and to work through what the actual technicalities are.' Nigel Farage's job as an MEP will cease to exist when we leave the EU, and he has repeatedly failed to win a seat in the House of Commons Young Brexiteers react with jubilation to the EU referendum results at a party thrown by Leave.EUBusiness Minister Anna Soubry said: 'I will respect the result. It's a dreadful decision. We have to make the best of it.'Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles said: 'Very sad at the decision #EUref , but that is how democracy works, so we better get on with it.' Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he believed around two-thirds of Labour voters backed Remain. 'A lot of Conservative voters have gone for out. There's a solid base on the Tory party for out that have gone against their own Prime Minister,' he told Sky News.'Within the Labour vote I think it looks as though two-thirds one-third split, might be less than that, we'll see.' Ex Labour leader Ed Miliband said a Remain majority would be 'a vote for staying in the EU, but not a vote for the status quo in this country'.'Whatever happens, the country will need to come together, there will need to be healing,' he said.'It's a nation divided and the PM will have a big responsibility - particularly if it's a Remain win - to show he understands what people are saying on the Leave side of the argument. SNP Minister Humza Yousaf at the EU Referendum count for Glasgow (left) and volunteers at the Royal Horticultural Halls in London counting the ballot papersAs the result in Sunderland gives Brexit a huge win, Leave campaigners in London celebrate with utter jubilation at a victory so big it indicates in the early stages that they may have the edge Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham speaks to a colleague as the EU referendum ballot vote count gets under way at the Manchester (left).

As far as Labour voters are concerned, there are two issues. There is obviously immigration, but beneath that there is a whole set of issues about people's lives and the fact that they don't feel politics is listening to them.' Ukip MEP Diane James said the large win for Leave in Sunderland could be down to anger over the local Nissan car plant writing to employees to make clear the company would prefer Britain to stay in the EU.She told BBC News: 'Nissan, I believe, was one of those companies that was effectively asked by the Prime Minister to write a letter to the employees and I think what you're seeing here is the reaction to that, which I understand has been quite widespread across the country where people have actually taken offence at being directed to do something and then seemingly that whole message has been undermined in the later stage.' The Bank of England said it would take 'all necessary steps' to ensure monetary and financial stability in the wake of the Brexit vote.'The Bank of England is monitoring developments closely,' it said in a statement.'It has undertaken extensive contingency planning and is working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks. The Bank of England will take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability.'But Standard & Poor's said the Brexit decision was likely to see the country lose its AAA credit rating - potentially driving up the cost of government borrowing.Chief ratings officer Moritz Kraemer told the Financial Times: 'We think that a AAA-rating is untenable under the circumstances.'The turnout in parts of Scotland were lower than the rest of the country, with Glasgow at 56.3%. In Glasgow 253,000 ballot papers were verified out of a total electorate of 449,806.Moments after the polls closed at 10pm last night Mr Farage appeared to concede defeat. 'It's been an extraordinary referendum campaign, turnout looks to be exceptionally high and it looks like Remain will edge it,' he said.'Ukip and I are going nowhere and the party will only continue to grow stronger in the future.'   The Leave campaign got off to a great start in Sunderland but the party didn't start prematurely at the Leave.EU party in Westminster, where volunteers eagerly await the resultsBut when the Sunderland result came in, Leave campaigners jumped for joy, cheered and congratulated each other after a huge winDavid Cameron's close aide Liz Sugg attended a Stronger In referendum party at the Royal Festival Hall, where activists were wearing blue T-shirts and drinking from disposable cupsBut speaking at a Leave.EU referendum night party later as results started to flow in, Mr Farage stressed he was not ruling out a Leave victory and 'hoped and prayed' his sense defeat was wrong. 'The Eurosceptic genie is out of the bottle. And it will now not be put back,' he said.  Highlighting the government's controversial decision to extend voter registration deadline by two days to make up for the website going down for just a couple of hours, Mr Farage said: 'My sense of this is the government's registration scheme, getting two million voters on in the 48 hour extension maybe what tips the balance. I hope I'm wrong. I hope I am made a fool of.'But either way, whether I am right or wrong, if we do stay part of this union it is doomed, it is finished anyway.'If we fail tonight, it will not be us that kicks out the first brick from the wall but somebody else.'He added: 'We are running them close, they have been scared, they have behaved pretty appallingly. 'Win or lose this battle tonight, we will win this war, we will get our country back, we will get our independence back and we will get our borders back.' Early in the night Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was among senior Remain figures who voiced confidence they were on track for victory. She told BBC News: 'Obviously we've got a long night ahead of us. We are confident and hopeful that there will be a victory for the Remain campaign but we'll obviously have to see.' Nigel Farage told reporters that he thought the Remain camp had 'edged' the contest.

'If I was forced to call it I am reasonably confident that Remain gets a result.'  Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, another supporter of Brexit, said her instinct was that Remain would win the vote. But high-profile Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith cast doubt on Mr Farage's suggestion that Remain is set for victory.'I never quite follow what Nigel Farage says,' the former work and pensions secretary told the BBC. 'Quite often he says two different things at the same time.'I genuinely do not have a sense of how this has gone.'  The concern was etched into the face of Ed Miliband, former leader of the Labour party, as the referendum votes were countedA Vote Leave source stressed that no-one could know the results yet, and suggested Mr Farage had been 'unhelpful' throughout the campaign.Lord Ashdown said the result was 'too close to call' and insisted he had learnt not to make predictions following his promise at the general election to eat his hat after declaring the exit polls were wrong.He said: 'Once bittten, twice shy. I suspect eat my hat has gone down into the political lexicon against my name forever.'I don't think anybody can make a prediction, this is far too close. We are in the margin of error.'The Liberal Democrat former leader added: 'I think there has been a bit too much hyperbole. I'm not sure the political class has covered itself in glory in this and I suspect we have an electorate that is more confused than it needs to be.' Brendan Chilton, general secretary of Labour Leave, said: 'Nigel may have said that but until the votes are counted we don't really know what's happened.'It's a bit concerning if that is the case. I obviously hope we have won.'Mr Chilton said his gut feeling at 10pm was that Leave would 'win, just'. He added: 'Even if we don't win, if it's close, that is a magnificent achievement.'  Conservative former justice minister Damian Green said the result should 'settle it for a generation'.'A win is a win so it should put an end to it,' he added.  In Gibraltar, which is taking part in the referendum as a British overseas territory within the EU, turnout was a healthy 84 per cent. But torrential rain and flooding in the South East caused transport disruption which may have prevented some voters from reaching the ballot box in time. Some polling stations were forced to close, and two in Kingston-upon-Thames had to be relocated after becoming inundated.Paddy Ashdown joins supporters for the Stronger Together campaign in the shadow of the London Eye as they await the resultThe campaigns have brought people from different parties together, with Labour's Chuka Umunna, Member of Parliament for Streatham, and Conservative Nicky Morgan, Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities, campaigning togetherEddie Izzard joins supporters of the Stronger In Campaign at Royal Festival Hall in London after a hard-fought campaign the will finally come to an end when the official result is announced just after 7amAs the polls closed, more than 80 Brexit rebels in David Cameron's Tory party sent a letter to Downing Street urging him to stay on as PM whatever the result.With Mr Cameron's Remain campaign appearing on course for victory in the referendum, the group led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove reached out an olive branch.The intention of the letter - made public as soon as polls closed in the referendum - was to begin the process of healing wounds in the Tory Party.Some 84 Tories signed the letter to tell Mr Cameron: 'We believe whatever the British people decide you have both a mandate and a duty to continue leading the nation implementing our policies.'As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Gove, the signatories included Cabinet-level Brexit backers Chris Grayling and John Whittingdale, but not Iain Duncan Smith, who quit as work and pensions secretary shortly before the referendum.Tory MP Robert Syms said that two-thirds of Conservative MPs who broke with the PM to back Leave had signed the letter, but said it had not been possible to reach all of them to ask them to sign. Mr Duncan Smith said he was not asked to sign the letter but insisted Mr Cameron should stay on as PM.Mr Duncan Smith told BBC News: 'Actually I wasn't asked to sign the letter but I've been very public all along to say that I think he has a duty to stay.'I'm not in government any longer so I assume that's why I wasn't asked - I'm just a backbencher.'Mr Farage's early pessimism about the prospects for Brexit triggered a rise in the value of Sterling by almost a cent against the dollar as the markets breathed a sigh of relief. The counter at Sunderland rushes to get the results through in the city first to return their verdict in tonight's referendum Boris Johnson hijacked his own daughter's graduation earlier today by unveiling a Brexit banner with just hours to go until polls close in the historic EU referendum As his 22-year-old daughter Lara was enjoying her big day at St Andrews University in Fife, Scotland, the leading Vote Leave campaigner waved a poster with the words: 'Last chance to vote'. But one student defied the ex-London Mayor by marching up to collect her degree with a Remain poster of her own as voters went to the polls across the country. Mr Johnson performed the stunt as he sat in the balcony of the Younger Hall alongside his wife Marina Wheeler QC, revealing the poster to the packed audience and causing mayhem as students then unveiled their own 'Remain' messages to the crowds. Lara Johnson was awarded a degree in Latin and Comparative Literature from the Scottish university. Her dad flew up to Scotland for the occasion, posing for selfies with excited students after four months of hard-fought campaigning to persuade voters to back Britain leaving the EU. Ali West said she could not pass up the opportunity to make the Remain case to Mr Johnson, insisting: 'Boris Johnson was in the audience at my graduation today, so naturally I had some thoughts.' Speaking this evening, the Leave champion said: 'From what I have heard and all the information is that turnout is good in areas where we need it to be.'  Regional Counting Officer Sue Stanhope announces the turnout for Sunderland as 64.9 per cent and Leave emerge victorious with 61.3 per cent of the vote.

From hope (left), to shock (centre) and confusion (right), the evening will be a rollercoaster for the man who has campaigned on the issue for 25 yearsPollsters have been left licking their wounds after following up on their abject failure to predict last year's general election result by calling the referendum wrong.Last night a flurry of eve-of-referendum polls suggested the result is still too close to call. A YouGov poll for The Times gave Remain a lead of 51 to 49. FTI Consulting gave Remain the edge by 51.4 per cent to 48.6 per cent once 'don't knows' are taken out.YouGov chief Peter Kellner has admitted that the failure was 'embarrassing'. Two further polls by Opinium and TNS showed the reverse, with Leave on 51 per cent and Remain on 49 per cent. Opinium Research recorded a tiny lead for Brexit in its final survey of 3,000 voters this week as it found 45 per cent backed Leave and 44 per cent backed Remain.But after taking into account the margin of error in the study, the firm declared it impossible to predict a winner.A week ago, Opinium had the referendum tied at 44 per cent each while at the start of June the pollster had Remain ahead 43-41.The poll fits with the mixed found by all of the polling firms in the last week of the race, with some results showing small leads for either side while other showed a tie.By contrast, betting markets have continued to show Remain as the strong favourite as the race enters its final hours. Adam Drummond, of Opinium Research said: 'This really is ''too close to call'' territory with undecided voters holding the balance of the vote in their hands.'Although referendum campaigns normally see a move back to the status quo as we get closer to polling day, this hasn't yet shown up in our polls and the Remain camp will have to hope that it happens in the polling booth itself if Britain is to stay in the European Union.' In its latest poll, Opinium interviewed 3,011 voters between Monday and Wednesday. David Cameron delivering his resignation statement this morningThe country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise – perhaps the biggest in our history. Over 33 million people – from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar – have all had their say.We should be proud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people with these big decisions.We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we are governed, there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves - and that is what we have done.The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument, including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believed was the national interest.And let me congratulate all those who took part in the leave campaign – for the spirited and passionate case that they made.The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision.So there can be no doubt about the result.Across the world people have been watching the choice that Britain has made. I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain's economy is fundamentally strong.And I would also reassure Brits living in European countries and European citizens living here that there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances. There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union. This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Governments, to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced.But above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership.I am very proud and very honoured to have been Prime Minister of this country for six years.I believe we have made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history; with reforms to welfare and education; increasing people's life chances; building a bigger and stronger society; keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world, and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality.But above all restoring Britain's economic strength, and I am grateful to everyone who has helped to make that happen.I have also always believed that we have to confront big decisions – not duck them.That's why we delivered the first Coalition government in seventy years to bring our economy back from the brink. It's why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland. And why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain's position in the European Union and hold a referendum on our membership, and have carried those things out.I fought this campaign in the only way I know how – which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel – head, heart and soul.I held nothing back.I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union, and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone – not the future of any single politician, including myself.But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.This is not a decision I have taken lightly, but I do believe it is in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required.There is no need for a precise timetable today, but in my view we should aim to have a new Prime Minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October.Delivering stability will be important and I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my Cabinet for the next three months. The Cabinet will meet on Monday.The Governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the Bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets. We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen's Speech. And I have spoken to Her Majesty the Queen this morning to advise her of the steps that I am taking.A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new Prime Minister, and I think it is right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU.I will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken and my own decision.The British people have made a choice. That not only needs to be respected – but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.Britain is a special country.We have so many great advantages.A parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate; a great trading nation, with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity respected the world over.And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multi-racial, multi-faith democracy, where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows.Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I have said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union and indeed that we could find a way.Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way, and I will do everything I can to help.I love this country – and I feel honoured to have served it.And I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed. 

Bonfire of the EU laws: From crooked cucumbers to powerful vacuum cleaners, the barmy Brussels regulations we can now get rid of2016-6-24As the country reflects in the wake of the EU referendum, Leave voters are celebrating changing the course of history and breaking free from the shackles of the European Union - and its laws and regulations.Despite the fact Britain has voted in favour of leaving the EU, this is still the start of a long process before the country officially untangles from the network of institutions in Brussels.And among that network there were a number of bizarre - and some argued trivial - rules the Brussels bureaucracy passed.Here are some of the more bizarre regulations the Brexiters can enjoy saying goodbye to. Scroll down for video David Cameron said he could not be the 'captain of the ship' while the UK negotiated its exit from the EU as he announced he would be resigning as Prime Minister and Tory leader Boris Johnson stopped short of confirming that he would stand to succeed David Cameron today - but made a broad appeal to people stay calm and help forge a better future1. Ban on curvy bananas and crooked cucumbers  The first - and one which reared its head as the Brexit and Remain camps drew up their battles lines - was the banana regulation.An example often cited as 'legislative heavy-handedness' was the EU ban on  'bendy bananas' and crooked cucumbers.A 1994 EU regulation specified that bananas must be 'free from abnormal curvature.' A 1994 EU regulation specified that bananas must be 'free from abnormal curvature' and cucumbers needed to be straight EU rules also governed the shape of many other fruits and vegetables — cucumbers, for example, needed to be almost perfectly straight. Many of these specifications were abolished in 2008, though the banana guidelines remain on the books.Just days ago, Boris Johnson became embroiled in a bizarre row over EU rules on how bananas should be sold. The strange row was triggered by comments Mr Johnson made as he took his referendum bus tour to the Midlands ahead of the vote.Delivering a stump speech to a crowd in Stafford, Mr Johnson said: 'If we take back control on June 23, we can also get rid of so much of the pointless rules and regulations that are holding back this country. 'It is absurd that we are told you cannot sell bananas of bunches of more than two or three bananas. You cannot sell bananas with abnormal curvature of the fingers. Why should they tell us?'Why should they tell us how powerful our vacuum cleaners should be? Why should they tell us how powerful our hairdryers should be?'This is not a matter for an international, supranational body to dictate to the British people.' Government banned the import of 100-watt bulbs2. Incandescent lightbulbs Something else that could now make a return is the incandescent lightbulb. Incandescent bulbs have been phased out in stages in the UK since 2009 following European regulations.The Government banned the import of 100-watt bulbs from 2009, followed by a ban on 60w bulbs in 2011 and a full ban on all 'traditional' bulbs in 2012.The bulbs were branded environmentally-unfriendly because some 95 per cent of the energy that goes into them gets turned into heat rather than light.Following the EU's ban on incandescent light-bulbs, many people were reported to have suffered epileptic fits from the flickering, supposedly eco-friendly fluorescent bulbs. 3. Vacuum cleanersOn his campaign trail in recent weeks, Boris Johnson also blasted Brussels red tape that he said placed burdensome extra costs on UK retailers selling products such as bananas, vacuum cleaners and hairdryers.The European Commission triggered an outcry by banning powerful vacuum cleaners two years ago.From September 1, 2014, companies were prohibited from manufacturing or importing any vacuum cleaners above the 1,600-watt limit as part of a drive to reduce domestic electricity use. The European Commission triggered an outcry by banning powerful vacuum cleaners two years ago (file photo)A furore broke out when shoppers panic-bought high-powered vacuum cleaners ahead of the deadline in 2014.This directive was expected to be extended to kettles, toasters, hair-dryers and other domestic appliances but it was shelved earlier this year amid fears it would drive the British public towards the EU exit door.In 2011, a ruling claimed drinking water did not ease dehydration4. Drinking water does not prevent dehydrationIn 2011, a ruling by the European Commission claimed that drinking water 'does not ease dehydration'.EU authorities passed a law which claimed scientists had found no evidence to suggest drinking water stopped dehydration. Manufacturers of bottled water were prohibited from labelling products with claims that would suggest consumption would fight dehydration.5. 'Diabetics' banned from drivingEuropean laws introduced in 2011 meant that drivers who treat their diabetes with insulin who have had one or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, known as 'hypos', could face losing their licences. If sufferers had one or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia - when a patient's blood sugars drop to dangerously low levels - and required assistance from another person, they would have to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).Diabetes UK said that the DVLA did not differentiate between daytime and night-time episodes of hypoglycaemia, meaning that some people with diabetes are losing their driving licence unnecessarily.European laws introduced in 2011 meant that drivers who treat their diabetes with insulin who have had one or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, known as 'hypos', could face losing their licencesAfter a review of evidence, the European Commission said in March this year the driving ban for people experiencing recurrent severe hypoglycaemia when asleep should be lifted. Diabetes UK said the DVLA will be asked to make the changes by 2018.6. It is illegal to eat your pet horseIn 2009 a law set out it was illegal to eat 'pet' horses after figures revealed that around two million pet horses were eaten across the EU each year.According to the guidelines, all horses, ponies, donkeys and related animals (including zoo species like zebras) must have a horse passport.The passport is a small booklet that identifies an owner's animal by its height and species.It also states whether the animal can be used for food at the end of its life.Owners can declare that the animal isn't intended for human consumption by filling in the appropriate section of the passport. This cannot be changed later.7. Jams, jellies and marmalade guidelines In 2010, a directive was made relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut puree intended for human consumption. EU rules stated that a preserve must contain at least 60 per cent sugar to be called a jam.  Anything containing less had to be called a 'fruit spread', while a low sugar jam with less than 50 per cent of sugar was named a 'conserve'.However these laws were relaxed in 2013. In 2010, a directive was made relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut puree intended for human consumption8. Olive oil in restaurantsThree years ago, the European Union planned to ban the glass jar which is filled, and refilled, with olive oil and served on restaurant tables across the EU, stating that only non-refillable bottles with proper labeling on the contents would be accepted.Bureaucrats had originally argued that diners were at risk of being served 'inferior' or diluted oil, which could also harbour germs if served in an open dish or bottle.Officials had wanted to force restaurateurs to only serve oil in its original bottles, with tamper-proof lids.The 2013 olive oil plan, intended to ensure hygiene and curtail fraud, set off a barrage of complaints - including from David Cameron - and never actually took effect. A waiter refills an empty bottle of olive oil at an Italian restaurant in BrusselsHundreds of media were packed into Downing Street to watch Mr Cameron deliver his resignation statement in the wake of the referendumEarlier this month, senior Tory Cabinet ministers published six pieces of legislation they hoped to pass to restore Britain's border controls and end the supremacy of EU law following a Brexit.Michael Gove, Chris Grayling and Boris Johnson set out what is effectively a manifesto for a 'government in waiting'.They pledged that the new laws would be in place by the next General Election in 2020. Finance Bill: This would abolish the 5 per cent rate of VAT on household energy bills. Paid for by savings from the UK’s contributions to the EU budget.National Health Service (Funding Target) Bill: Requirement that by the next general election, the NHS receives a £100million per week real-terms cash transfusion on top of current plans. Paid for by savings from the UK’s contributions to EU budget.Asylum and Immigration Control Bill: Ends the automatic right of all EU citizens to enter the UK by the next election. Criminals refused entry and a ‘non-discriminatory’ Australian points-based system, based on skills, introduced for those wishing to enter from inside and outside the EU.European Union Law (Emergency Provisions) Bill: This would end the European Court of Justice’s control over national security, allow ministers to remove EU citizens whose presence is not conducive to the public good – including terrorists and serious criminals – and end the growing use of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to overrule UK law.Free Trade Bill: The UK would leave the EU’s ‘common commercial policy’. That would restore the UK Government’s power to set its own trade policy. UK would take back seat on the World Trade Organization.European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill: Ensures the European Communities Act 1972 – the legal basis for supremacy of EU law – is repealed. EU Treaties will cease to form part of UK law and European Court’s jurisdiction will end. UK would cease to contribute to the EU budget. EU law to be transferred into domestic law with Parliament choosing what to keep, remove or amend.

Brexiteers raise fears the Commons could MUTINY over quitting the EU single market as three quarters of them never wanted Out in the first place  2016-6-24MPs who campaigned for Remain were warned to respect the will of the people last night amid fears they could try to frustrate the Brexit result.Some on the In side have called for sympathetic members on all benches – Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and SNP – to use their overwhelming majority in the Commons to keep Britain in the single market.They want to sign the UK up to a Norway-style relationship with the EU that would bring full access to the single market on the same terms as now, but would result in Britain having to accept continued freedom of movement.Former Tory MP Matthew Parris today the single market had not been on the ballot paper, stoking concern among Brexiteers the Commons could refuse to pass the necessary laws.  Some on the In side have called for sympathetic members on all benches – Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and SNP – to use their overwhelming majority in the Commons to keep Britain in the single marketOut campaigners have warned that such a move would spark a constitutional crisis because it would counter the spirit of a pro-Brexit referendum result and ignore public concerns over EU immigration.Some legal experts point out that the referendum is not legally binding – meaning MPs could in theory ignore it, no matter how politically difficult. The closeness of the result – 52 per cent in favour of Leave – could also give some MPs the excuse to call for not complying with the result.But last night Bernard Jenkin, the Tory pro-Leave MP, said the referendum was clear-cut.‘No one has a mandate from the voters to keep us in the single market, and the same applies to free movement,’ he said. ‘Michael Gove could not have been more explicit that leaving the EU means leaving the single market. The EU is the single market, and the single market is the EU.’In his regular Times column, Mr Parris said: 'Thursday’s result was not a vote to leave the single market: this was never on the ballot paper.'Except with a Ukip-Tory alliance, any foreseeable Commons would block a (forgive me) smexit. Britain can instead leave and seek a status such as Norway’s — with free movement of labour.'MPs on the Remain side said voting in favour of the single market – dubbed guerrilla tactics by one source – would be justified because they claim the Leave side has not set out the nature of Britain’s trading relationship with the EU after departure.The Commons is overwhelmingly pro-EU, with just over 70 per cent of members having campaigned for Remain.A slight majority of Tory MPs were pro-Remain, along with almost all Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs.Out campaigners have warned that such a move would spark a constitutional crisis because it would counter the spirit of a pro-Brexit referendum result and ignore public concerns over EU immigrationLeaving the EU will require an act of parliament, but the Tory majority is only 12 – meaning that even if the Government tabled a bill to repeal EU membership, it would take only a few MPs to overturn the will of the people.Earlier this month, one pro-European MP said: ‘We would have to respect the mandate of the referendum, but there is still plenty of scope on how and when we quit the EU.’A source told the Guardian earlier this month that MPs may even seek to reverse a pro-Brexit decision altogether if the negotiations with the EU on the UK’s exit terms produce a disastrous deal.Labour’s Stephen Kinnock told the BBC: ‘If the British people voted to leave the EU that’s one thing. But can we really say they voted for the devastation and destruction of the entire exporting sector of our economy?’ 

Brexit will NOT cause a recession but help Britain thrive, Michael Gove defiantly claims in a plea to the country to 'vote for hope'2016-6-19Michael Gove, pictured today arriving for an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr Michael Gove today denied there would be a recession triggered by a Brexit vote on Thursday, rejecting an economic consensus warning of a downturn if voters quit the EU.The Justice Secretary said Britain would in fact thrive if freed from the constraints of Brussels and in an 11th hour plea to the electorate, urged them to 'vote for hope'.Mr Gove's intervention, ahead of a major TV interview today, comes as the referendum campaign gradually resumes following the shocking killing of Labour MP Jo Cox.Both sides of the referendum battle shut down for two days after the shocking events on Thursday as a shattered Westminster was left reeling by the attack.Mr Gove's intervention, in the Sunday Telegraph, urged voters to support democracy when they go to the polls on Thursday.He told the paper: 'There are great things that Britain can do in the future as a progressive beacon.'By voting Leave, we have that opportunity. 'People should vote for democracy and Britain should vote for hope.'Mr Gove said: 'I can't foretell the future but I don't believe that the act of leaving the European Union would make our economic position worse, I think it would make it better.' Amid reports some Tories are lining up Theresa May as a 'caretaker' replacement for David Cameron should he lose on Thursday, Mr Gove insisted the Prime Minister should stay on whatever the result.He told the Telegraph: 'I absolutely think that David Cameron should stay, whatever the result of the referendum and I hope that he will stay for the full second term which he was elected to serve.'I don't want to have anyone else as Prime Minister other than David Cameron and if people spend their time thinking about some of this stuff then they are getting in the way of two things: one a fair, open, fact-based referendum debate; and two, the Conservative government continuing afterwards in a stable and secure fashion.' In his own return to campaigning today, Mr Cameron warned the economy 'hangs in the balance' on Thursday.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Prime Minister said: 'If you're not sure, don't take the risk of leaving... If you don't know, don't go.'He added: 'If we choose to go out of the EU, we will go out – with all of the consequences that will have for everyone in Britain.Prime Minister David Cameron resumed campaigning activities today, two days after an extraordinary joint appearance with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Birstall, Yorkshire, pictured. Mr Cameron warned the economy 'hangs in the balance' on Thursday 'If we were to leave and it quickly turned out to be a big mistake, there wouldn't be a way of changing our minds and having another go.'The Sunday Times today said senior Conservatives were planning on how to deal with the aftermath of the referendum 'if everything goes wrong'.Sources told the paper Home Secretary Mrs May could be thrust forward to ease the party through a transition period.An unnamed cabinet minister said: 'Several of us are talking about whether she should be a caretaker leader to get things back on an even keel.'Several people who might run themselves would be prepared to put aside their own ambitions to back her.' 

Brexit vote hangs in the balance after Jo Cox murder: Polls divided after MP's killing leaves country undecided ahead of EU referendum2016-6-19The Brexit vote is in the balance with polls showing the country may still be undecided ahead of Thursday's EU referendum.A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday found Remain had opened up a three-point lead in the wake of the killing of the Labour MP Jo Cox.But another survey revealed today shows the two sides are level while a third has voters saying they are more enthusiastic about leaving the EU than staying.Ukip leader Nigel Farage today said the killing could have halted 'momentum' behind the Leave campaign.  The Brexit vote is in the balance with polls showing the country may still be undecided ahead of Thursday's EU referendum. In One poll out today, by Opinium for the Observer, shows the race finely balanced at 44-44. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday shows Remain ahead 45-42 but a YouGov survey for Good Morning Britain shows Leave ahead 44 to 42. A fourth survey by BMG for Herald found Remain on 46 per cent to Leave on 43 per cent A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday found Remain had opened up a three-point lead in the wake of the Killing of the Labour MP Jo Cox (pictured)Campaigning was due to resume today after a suspension lasting more than two days following the fatal attack on Mrs Cox, a strong supporter of Britain staying in the EU.The man charged with her murder, Thomas Mair, gave his name as 'death to traitors, freedom for Britain' when he appeared in court on Saturday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to take part in a major BBC interview to mark Mrs Cox's death and make the case for Remain.The BBC's Andrew Marr will also interview Michael Gove as campaigning resumes with just four days to go, while Chancellor George Osborne and Ukip leader Nigel Farage are both due to be grilled by ITV's Robert Peston.Prime Minister David Cameron will take part in a live BBC Question Time special tonight to make his case for staying in the UK.  Survation's results changed dramatically in polls carried before and after Thursday's tragic events. On Thursday, the firm found Leave was ahead by 45-42 but another poll carried out yesterday showed the reverse. In both surveys 13 per cent of people were still undecided Ukip leader Nigel Farage today the 'momentum' behind the Leave campaign was halted when the referendum was halted by Mrs Cox's killing.He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: I think we have momentum.'We did have momentum until this terrible tragedy. It has had an impact on the whole campaign for everybody.'When you are taking on the establishment, you need to have momentum. I don't know what's going to happen over the course of the next three to four days, but (this was) the action of one person with serious mental issues.'What we saw was an act of terrorism.'Today's Survation poll was gathered on Friday and Saturday as the nation mourned Mrs Cox and showed Remain on 45 per cent with Leave on 42 per cent.And the gap could get bigger: 46 per cent say Remain are likely to benefit from any additional late surge, with 33 per cent forecasting a late swing to Leave.  The findings reversed the result of Survation data on Thursday which had Leave ahead on 45 per cent and Remain on 42 per cent.Ukip leader Nigel Farage today said the Leave campaign had momentum before Thursday's killing of Jo Cox but admitted the tragedy would have an unknown effect on all the campaigns Earlier, a clutch of polls conducted either partially or fully before campaigning was suspended following the death of Mrs Cox on Thursday, continued to present a mixed picture. Opinium for The Observer puts the two sides level on 44 per cent  - with Leave up two points on last week while Remain was unchanged.A UK-wide BMG telephone survey for The Herald put Remain ahead on 46 per cent with Leave on 43 per cent, and 11 per cent undecided or unwilling to say.By using a series of questions to calculate the likely voting intention of people who say that they will vote but have yet to decide or do not want to say, BMG put the Remain camp ahead on 53 per cent compared to 47 per cent.Meanwhile a ComRes Poll for The Sunday People and The Independent suggests voters are more enthusiastic about leaving the EU than staying, with 44 per cent saying they would be 'delighted' with an Out vote compared to just 28 per cent who would feel that way about In.According to the Sunday Mirror, attitudes towards the referendum shifted as news of the attack on Mrs Cox broke.Pollsters for the newspaper were still gathering responses as news of the shooting emerged. Figures showed the Remain camp receive a nine point boost after 2pm on Thursday from people saying they would be 'delighted' if Britain stayed in the EU.According to a Survation poll for the Mail On Sunday, the Remain vote has surged ahead of Brexit since Thursday's murder of Jo Cox in West YorkshireAndrew Hawkins, chairman of ComRes, told the Independent that the attack might have influenced responses.He said: 'Not all respondents will have learned of the attack immediately, and the results should be taken with a degree of caution, but across all emotions reaction to a Leave vote was more negative among those interviewed after 2pm on Thursday.' Meanwhile, a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times newspaper showed support for Britain staying in the EU had restored a narrow 44-43 per cent lead over the 'Out' campaign. That poll was based on interviews conducted on Thursday and Friday, but the Sunday Times said the shift did not reflect the fatal attack on a British lawmaker on Thursday which led to the suspension of referendum campaigning.Instead, the bounce in support for 'In' was more a reflection of growing concerns among voters about the economic impact of a so-called Brexit, it said.- Survation interviewed 1,001 adults by telephone on June 17 and 18. - Opinium interviewed 2,006 UK adults online between June 14 and 17. - ComRes interviewed 2,046 GB adults online between June 15 and 16. - BMG interviewed 1,043 UK residents aged 18 and over by telephone between June 10 and 15.  Campaigning was due to resume today after a suspension lasting more than two days following the fatal attack on Mrs Cox, a strong supporter of Britain staying in the EUA clutch of polls conducted either partially or fully before campaigning was suspended following the death of Mrs Cox on Thursday, continued to present a mixed picture

We can't have ANY limit on free movement in Europe claims Jeremy Corbyn as he blasts the Government for failing to make sure communities can cope 2016-6-19Jeremy Corbyn today admitted he did not think there was a limit on free movement of people within the EU.The comments, just four days before the referendum, will frustrate many on the Remain side determined to shift the argument to the economy.Vote Leave immediately seized on the remarks as evidence Remain campaigners had 'no answers' on how to control immigration numbers. Mr Corbyn has argued before Government has responsibility for mitigating the impact of free movement by ensure enough services are provided to communities.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on today's Andrew Marr programme, said said he did not think it was possible to cap free movement within the single market of the European UnionAppearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Corbyn was asked directly whether he thought there should be an upper limit on the numbers coming to the UK.Mr Corbyn blamed Eurozone austerity for driving up migration across Europe - and condemned the European Central Bank for its treatment of Greece. He said: 'I don't think you can have one while you have the free movement of labour, and the free movement of labour means that you have to balance the economy.'So you have to improve living standards and conditions and so that means the EU's appalling treatment of Greece is a problem.'If you deliberately lower living standards and increase poverty in south eastern Europe, then you're bound to have a flow of people looking for somewhere to go.'Surely the issue is an anti-austerity, growth package all across Europe rather than this.'Mr Corbyn said pressures caused by free movement were the fault of government failing to address rising demand for services.He said: 'It's a failure of our government to properly fund local authorities, it's a failure of our government to provide housing for people, it's a failure of our government for attacking school budgets.'It's that that is the problem and they should turn their anger against this government and the austerity that's been put forward by Cameron and Osborne over the past six years.'Mr Corbyn attacked the European Union for imposing austerity on countries such as Greece and said new economic policies were important to ease migration across the continent Mr Corbyn, who has made the argument about immigration in the past, said it was not true to say there was 'uncontrolled immigration'.He insisted: 'There is no uncontrolled immigration, there is free movement of people across the EU that goes both ways - more than two million British people are living in Europe.'There is controlled immigration from outside Europe.'I represent a very mixed constituency where there are great problems of getting family reunions and there are not equal rights for people coming in from Europe - they don't get benefits and they don't get access to benefits. It's not totally uncontrolled.'Vote Leave chairwoman Gisela Stuart said: 'The IN campaign have no answers on how we can control immigration if we stay in the EU.'They have no plan for how we will fund the NHS so it can cope with the extra pressures that staying in the EU will create.'They have no plan for where we will build the extra houses and they have no plan to help people who will see further pressure on their pay packets.'The only way to get a fairer immigration policy and to bring in an Australian style points-based system is to Vote Leave on 23 June.' In a separate interview yesterday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan also said there should be no upper limit.The comments cap a week of chaos among Labour ranks over the issue. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the party would ‘look again’ at free movement of labour.Deputy leader Tom Watson said the party would have to make the case to revise the EU edict. He added that while he backed In, the issue of uncontrolled migration was ‘coming up on the doorstep’ and people needed reassurance.Ukip’s Mike Hookem said Labour’s policy on immigration was ‘farcical’ and ‘they do not have an answer to people’s genuine concerns’.It came as George Osborne was accused of being ‘wrong’ on immigration by economist Jonathan Portes. The Chancellor told ITV he’d ‘seen absolutely no evidence migration levels will fall’ in the event of Brexit.But a report by Mr Portes’s think-tank NIESR worked on the basis a Leave vote would see net migration from the EU fall by two thirds compared with a Remain vote.

Now Bank of England claims Brexit fears are ALREADY stopping us from buying cars and houses2016-6-16People are already holding off on buying homes and cars because of fears over a Brexit vote, the Bank of England has warned.The Bank said 'major economic decisions' were increasingly being put on hold ahead of the crucial referendum next week. Policy makers also said it was 'increasingly probable' that the value of the Pound will slump if we vote for Brexit.The assessment - in the latest minutes of the Monetary Policy committee - came as the Bank's governor Mark Carney insisted he has every right to comment on the economic impact of Brexit.He was angrily accused of breaking impartiality rules by leading Leave campaigner Bernard Jenkin.Mark Carney, whose Bank of England today warned individual's major economic decisions are being postponed by the referendum, has been involved in an angry clash with a Tory MP The Bank insisted it is 'increasingly probable' a Leave vote in next week's referendum would sharply damage the value of Sterling across international money markets.Financial experts warned uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the poll is already forcing consumers to put off 'major economic decisions' and provoking a slowdown in house and car sales.The Bank insisted the referendum remains the 'largest immediate risk' facing financial markets, as its Monetary Policy Committee decided to hold rates at the 0.5 per cent level they have been at since March 2009.The latest foray into the increasingly bitter referendum debate came after an angry war of words exploded between Mr Carney and prominent Tory MP and Leave campaigner Mr Jenkin.Bank sources revealed Mr Carney considers a letter from Mr Jenkin stating that the governor had made his views on the referendum public despite strict impartiality rules to be a 'political threat'.Commons Public Administration Committee chairman Mr Jenkin hit back by branding the governor 'very aggressive'.Mr Jenkin branded the Governor's letter 'very aggressive' and slammed him for surrendering his independence In a strident response, Mr Carney said Mr Jenkin's letter contained 'numerous and substantial misconceptions'.Mr Carney also accused Mr Jenkin of having a 'fundamental misunderstanding' about the independence of the Bank.The governor wrote: 'All of the public comments that I, and other Bank officials, have made regarding issues related to the referendum have been limited to factors that affect the Bank's statutory responsibilities and have been entirely consistent with our remits.'Mr Jenkin said Mr Carney's intervention in the referendum debate has gone 'way beyond what a Bank governor would normally do in terms of making statements about rate setting and economic forecasts'.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'He has reacted very, very aggressive towards me.'There is no doubt that the appearance he made on the Andrew Marr programme went way beyond what a Bank governor would normally do in terms of making statements about rate setting and economic forecasts. 'I obviously misconstrued that because in my letter to him I said he had made his views clear that he wants the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union.'The Prime Minister said: 'If we vote to leave the European Union, we are facing higher unemployment, less growth, we're facing a falling pound, therefore rising prices.'The price of the family shop would go up. There would be fewer jobs, fewer opportunities. This is a risk to every family in Britain. This couldn't be clearer. We shouldn't risk it.'Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured with motoring duo Jeremy Clarkson and James May today, noted the latest warnings from the Bank of England and said it showed Britain should not 'risk' Brexit Mr Cameron added: 'The Bank of England is independent. It's independent in law, and the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England has met and has discussed the risks of leaving the European Union and they couldn't be clearer.' Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott said: 'All the latest indicators show that the British economy is doing well despite George Osborne and Mark Carney's attempts to whip up fear in the markets. Manufacturing is up, retail sales are increasing and more people are in work.'Mark Carney earned millions when he was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.'Goldman Sachs made huge profits when it dishonestly cooked the books so that Greece could join the euro and we all know what a disaster that has been. Goldman Sachs is now bankrolling the IN campaign.' Lord Darling, Labour ex-chancellor, accused Mr Jenkin of engaging in a 'blatant attempt to muzzle a respected independent voice'.Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott dismissed the report as another attempt to 'whip up' fears over Brexit ahead of next week's referendum Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested supporters of his party may be backing the Brexit option because they do not understand what Leave would mean.'I think a lot of people haven't understood the relationship with the European Union, haven't appreciated the amount of investment that's come in to many parts of this country,' he said.'I think that many people don't realise that the implications of voting to leave on the 23rd could be quite serious - could be quite serious in export industries that rely on selling goods across Europe.'Despite growing calls in Labour's top team for reform of free movement of workers' rules, Mr Corbyn insisted: 'The European Union actually depends on the movement of people across the continent.'European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned UK voters 'would be best advised' to oppose Brexit.Speaking in St Petersburg, Russia, he said withdrawal would spark 'a period of major uncertainty' for both Britain and the EU. 

The final push: Cameron, Johnson and Corbyn criss-cross the country in last frantic round of referendum campaigning2016-6-22The big beasts of the EU referendum battle are engaged in a final frantic round of campaigning on the eve of the crucial poll.David Cameron joined forces with former PM Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet Harman for a rally in Bristol before travelling to Oxfordshire, Banbury and then Birmingham.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has visited the famous Billingsgate Fish market as he traversed the country in a Vote Leave helicopter.The ex-mayor of London then headed north, visiting Selby and Darlington before signing off his campaign. As the final salvoes of the campaigns were released, the referendum battle went down to the wire tonight as a major pollster declared the race a 'statistical dead heat' based on its final snapshot of voters.6.15pm: David Cameron made his final pitch to voters in Birmingham, appearing with Gordon Brown and leading politicians from across the political spectrum at an end of campaign rally 5.30pm:  Boris Johnson stopped off at the George Pub in Darlington to pour a pint and press the case for Vote Leave as he scrambled around the country making his final pitch4.30pm: David Cameron received a noisy welcome from school children as he arrived at the Warriner School in Bloxham, near Banbury Opinium recorded a tiny lead for Brexit in its final survey of 3,000 voters this week as it found 45 per cent backed Leave and 44 per cent backed Remain.But after taking into account the margin of error in the study, the firm declared it impossible to predict a winner.A week ago, Opinium had the referendum tied at 44 per cent each while at the start of June the pollster had Remain ahead 43-41.The poll fits with the mixed found by all of the polling firms in the last week of the race, with some results showing small leads for either side while other showed a tie.  2.30pm: The Vote Leave campaign arrived in Selby, North Yorkshire as Boris Johnson pressed the case for Brexit with just a few hours until the polls opened 2.19pm: Planes carrying pro-Remain banners staged a fly-past at the Houses of Parliament this afternoon2pm: David Cameron and Harriet Harman met farmer David Christensen on Kington Hill Farm in Abingdon, Oxfordshire as he continued his campaign this afternoon Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed activists in central London, while planes trailing Remain banners staged a flypast at the Houses of Parliament.  During the rally in Bristol, Mr Cameron urged voters to stick with Brussels to ensure a 'bigger better Britain'.He rejected Leave claims that Britain would be 'shackled to a corpse' if it chose to stick in the EU, telling supporters in Bristol the Remain case could be summed up in the single word: 'Together'.'If we want a bigger economy and more jobs, we are better if we do it together,' the PM said.'If we want to fight climate change, we are better if we do it together. If we want to win against the terrorists and keep our country safe, we are better if we do it together.' Sir John took a swipe at Mr Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove as 'gravediggers of our prosperity', suggesting he had 'expected better' from them.1pm: Jeremy Corbyn addressed activists in central London after speaking at the Unison conference in Brighton this morningThe former London Mayor took to the skies in a helicopter to continue the push for BrexitMr Johnson has appealed for voters to make the EU referendum Britain's 'Independence Day'Quitting the EU would not stem immigration and risked creating a broken Britain, he insisted.Leaving would be a 'disproportionate' response to migration concerns and the country would live to regret it for a 'long time to come'. He said: 'If our nation does vote to leave, we must respect their decision, but if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the grave-diggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer.''They will have to account for what they have said and done but that will be of little consolation for we will be out, out for good, diminished as an influence on the world. 11.30am: Nigel Farage brandished his passport with EU markings during an appearance in London'A truly Great Britain shrunk down to a little England perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales, and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south by the border the controls that would then be the edge of the European Union.'Dismissing accusations that the Remain campaign had been 'project fear', he insisted that Mr Cameron had a 'duty' to to warn the nation of the dangers of quitting.10.30am: David Cameron was in Bristol at a rally with former Prime Minister Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet HarmanSir John took a swipe at Mr Johnson and Michael Gove, branding them the 'gravediggers of our prosperity'He said: 'In return for doing that he has faced a great deal of opposition and sometimes abuse from people who, frankly, we might have expected better from.'I think the way in which he has conducted himself in putting the country before self and the country before party is quite remarkable.' Mr Johnson, however, said it was 'time to break away from the failing and dysfunctional EU system', telling activists in Maldon, Essex: 'I do think that we are on the verge, possibly, of an extraordinary event in the history of our country and indeed in the whole of Europe.'It's all going to be about getting our supporters out to vote and if we do it I really think tomorrow can be independence day.'10am: Mr Cameron and Mrs Harman went to the offices of sports distribution firm Shiner in BristolMr Cameron, seen inspecting a skateboard with Shiner chief executive Charlie Allen, said Britain would be 'bigger and better' if it stayed in the EUCriss-crossing the country by plane, Mr Johnson signed autographs and posed for selfies in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.But he was heckled by 17-year-old Will Taylor who said: 'I'm annoyed that I can't vote and as a young person it's my future.'In a speech to Unison's annual conference in Brighton this morning, Mr Corbyn said Labour supported EU membership but wanted reform.11am: Mr Johnson went on a walkabout in Ashby de la Zouch as part of his final push for Brexit todayThe former London mayor posed for selfies and chatted to members of the public during his visitThursday's vote will be one of the most 'significant ' decisions ever taken in this country, he said.Mr Corbyn added: 'Labour formed the NHS, creating healthcare as a human right.

'I'm not a lover of the EU and it must change dramatically,' says Jeremy Corbyn as he lashes out at David Cameron's 'poisonous' and 'catastrophist' Remain campaign2016-6-20Jeremy Corbyn tonight lashed out at the 'poisonous' and 'catastrophist' warnings peddled by David Cameron in the EU referendum as he admitted: 'I'm not a lover of the European Union'.He insisted Europe will need to change 'quite dramatically' if Britain decides to stay in the EU as he made his final pitch to voters ahead of Thursday's historic referendum.He warned of 'massive' implications if Britain leaves the EU but again insisted there will never be an upper limit on immigration into the UK as long as we stay in. But the Labour leader, a life-long Eurosceptic, revealed his anti-EU views as he hit out at the EU for crippling Greece with austerity and failing to deal with the refugee crisis last year. He said Brussels must change regardless of whether Britain stays in as he told an audience of young voters: 'If we stay in Europe there are implications,' describing Thursday's vote as a 'turning point' for the continent.Jeremy Corbyn tonight lashed out at the 'poisonous' and 'catastrophist' warnings peddled by David Cameron in the EU referendum as he admitted: 'I'm not a lover of the European Union'The Labour leader said he 'doubts' the public 'truly understand' why we are holding a referendum on EU membership.  Mr Corbyn was facing questions  an audience of young voters at the Sky News studios in West London as the EU referendum enters its final hours ahead of Thursday's historic vote.He took the opportunity to hit out at Nigel Farage for his 'bigoted' poster telling voters to back Brexit because Europe was at 'breaking point' with Syrian refugees. And he praised Angela Merkel for welcoming Syrian refugees to Europe during the midst of the crisis, despite her move being blamed for hundreds of thousands of people making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to flee the violence in the Middle East. The Labour leader again defended Europe's open door immigration policy, insisting freedom of movement was crucial for the EU's single market. Instead of blaming migrants for driving down wages in the UK, people should instead look to exploitative businessmen such as Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who he said was responsible for the acceleration of controversial zero-hours contracts and poor working conditions in Britain. Tensions in both camps are high, with polls showing the vote is too close to call and leading politicians are making their final pitch to voters. Jeremy Corbyn (pictured) told young voters that the EU referendum campaign had been 'poisonous' as he hit out at the way figures such as David Cameron had made 'catastrophic' warningsJeremy Corbyn was facing questions an audience of young voters at the Sky News studios in West London as the EU referendum enters its final hours ahead of Thursday's historic voteThe audience questioned whether Jeremy Corbyn was truly in favour of leaving the EULeading figures in the referendum campaign have been criticised for creating a toxic atmosphere in politics in the light of Jo Cox's tragic killing last Thursday. Asked about the tone of the debate, Mr Corbyn was highly critical of figures such as George Osborne and Mr Cameron who have delivered dramatic warnings over the consequences of Brexit. 'I think a lot of it has been very poisonous with catastrophist theories on one side, or both sides, and really people should rationally think about it,' he told viewers tonight. Jeremy Corbyn was forced to confirm he will be voting in Thursday's historic EU referendum. His own brother Piers Corbyn suggested the Labour leader might decide not to vote in the referendum because of his life-long Eurosceptic views. He voted for Britain to quit the European Community in 1975 and has opposed a string of European treaties and measures ever since - including the contentious Maastricht Treaty in the early 1990s. But asked tonight by Sky News political editor Faisal Islam whether he'll definitely be voting Remain on Thursday, Mr Corbyn replied: 'Yes, I'll be there.'And dismissing his brother's suggestions, he added: 'My brother has many thoughts.'Piers Corbyn has said he will be voting for Brexit on Thursday and has in the past hinted Mr Corbyn might do the same when he's in the private polling booth - a claim repeatedly denied by the Labour leader's team. 'I'm not a lover of the European Union, I think it's a rational decision, we should stay in order to try and improve it but does that mean I change my views on public ownership of railways and things like that? Absolutely not.'But it means that I want to be working with people across Europe on environmental protection, on public ownership issues and I think we'd get a long way down the line like that.' Asked by audience member Lucy Kendrick whether the public 'truly understand why we are having the referendum and what they are voting for,' Mr Corbyn replied: 'I hope they do but I somewhat doubt it because this is a referendum that's been discussed amongst the political classes for some years, pushed very hard by those who wish to leave the European Union.' 'Do people fully understand all of it? Probably not, I would hope so but people I hope will just think quite seriously about it, it's a big decision.' He added: 'If we stay in Europe there implications, if we leave Europe there are massive implications. But it's also a turning point.'Warning voters not to back Brexit on Thursday, Mr Corbyn said: 'I don't think there's any easy way back. If we stay I think Europe has to change dramatically. 'There a couple of days to go and in my experience in the last two, three days when all the politicians have become exhausted the public have been increasingly interested in it.'My view is not unconditional on the EU by any means. I'm opposed to the way in which Europe shields tax havens, this country as well does it, and the way systemically big companies use legal loop holes.'If we challenge climate change you cannot do it in national borders. The refugee crisis has to be dealt with internationally. I want to remain in Europe in order to work to change it,' he said. Sky News political editor Faisal Islam (pictured right) asked Jeremy Corbyn whether he agreed the EU referendum campaign had been 'poisonous'. Corbyn (pictured left) replied: 'I think a lot of it has been very poisonous with catastrophist theories on one side, or both sides, and really people should rationally think about it'A young woman in the audience said young people had been put off the EU referendum by 'embarrassing, clownish figures such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage' Jeremy Corbyn was grilled by an audience of under-35 year-olds at the Sky News studio in West London Mr Corbyn was forced to confirm he will be voting in the EU referendum - dismissing claims by his brother Piers that he might decide to abstain because of his life-long Eurosceptic views. 'I'll be there,' Mr Corbyn joked, dismissing his brother's suggestions by telling an amused audience: 'My brother has many thoughts'. One audience member suggested the Labour leader's lack of passion for the EU will be blamed if Britain votes to leave the EU on Thursday, but Mr Corbyn said he was far of the mark. 'I'm not going to take blame for people’s decision,' he said defiantly. 'There will be a decision on Thursday and I hope there will be a Remain vote - there may will be a Remain vote, there may be a Leave vote.'Whatever the result that is the result of the referendum; we’ve got to work with it. And I would say to the EU, whatever the result, we want to see better working conditions across Europe.' Mr Corbyn insisted his support for a Remain vote was 'not unconditional by any means' before setting out a list of problems with Brussels, including the trade deal with the US currently being negotiated, the 'way in which Europe shields tax havens' and Brussels' failure to close loopholes in employment laws. But he said we must stay in the EU to tackle these problems and deal with cross-border issues such as climate change, environmental issues, and the refugee crisis.'I want to remain in Europe in order to work with others to change it,' he said. Jeremy Corbyn (pictured siting down, left) faced questions from a young audience and Sky News political editor Faisal Islam (pictured far right) Audience member Lucy Kendrick (pictured) asked Jeremy Corbyn whether the public truly understood the issues in the EU referendum campaign Mr Corbyn's appearance tonight was his final big TV appearance before Thursday's referendum.  Earlier today leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson today warned voters they have one chance to 'change the whole course of European history' by backing Brexit.Last night it was David Cameron's turn to make his final TV pitch to voters, using a special Question Time show to tell voters that a strong economy underpinned everything else as he attempted to bust Vote Leave's 'myths' on the disputed £350million figure that Britain sends to the EU each week, Turkey and plans for an EU army.Today referendum campaigning was again muted as MPs gathered in Westminster to pay tribute to Jo Cox at an emergency recall of the House of Commons in the wake of her killing on Thursday.Mr Corbyn led the tributes to the late Labour MP and demanded 'a kinder and gentler politics' in the light of her tragic killing. However on the referendum the Labour leader has come under fire from all sides for his views on immigration. As the referendum heads into its final hours, polls are mixed. Results out over the weekend revealed a tie, Remain leads of up to 3 per cent and Leave leads of 2% Yesterday he admitted there was no upper limit on immigration while Britain is insdie the EU - and blamed Brussels for driving huge numbers of workers to the UK. But he said there should be no changes to Brussels' edicts on free movement, which allow hundreds of thousands of EU citizens to move here every year.  This is despite immigration repeatedly being the top concern cited by Labour voters on the doorstep. His comments have caused frustration with fellow Remain campaigners, who are determined to shift the argument away from immigration - seen as a weak point for them - and on to the economy. His pro-immigration comments are also at odds with members of his own leadership team and cap a week of chaos among Labour ranks over immigration. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said in recent days that the party would 'look again' at free movement of labour.Deputy leader Tom Watson said the party would have to make the case to revise the EU edict. He added that while he backed In, the issue of uncontrolled migration was 'coming up on the doorstep' and people needed reassurance.Europe will need to change 'quite dramatically' if Britain decides to stay in the EU, Jeremy Corbyn said tonight as he made his final pitch to voters ahead of Thursday's historic referendum to an audience of young voters at the Sky News studios in West LondonJeremy Corbyn (pictured right alongside fellow politicians including David Cameron, deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, second left and George Osborne) led the tributes to Jo Cox and demanded 'a kinder and gentler politics' in the light of her tragic killingMeanwhile Vote Leave has pointed to Mr Corbyn's criticisms of Brussels as proof he is a secret Outer and is only campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU because his party's MPs are predominantly pro-EU.But Labour's Mayor of London Sadiq Khan echoed Mr Corbyn's stance on immigration, saying there should be no upper limit on the numbers coming into the UK.  His and Mr Corbyn's remarks on immigration have been seized on by Brexit supporters as evidence that staying in the EU gives Britain no chance of controlling immigration numbers.   Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured tonight) says he shouldn't be blamed if the Remain side loses on ThursdayJeremy Corbyn said he will not take any blame for the result if Britain votes to leave the EU on Thursday. The Labour leader, a life-long Eurosceptic, has been heavily criticised by Remain campaigners in and out of the party over his lack of passion for the EU in the referendum campaign. But tonight, pressed on whether he will shoulder some of the blame in the event of a Brexit vote, said: 'I’m not going to take blame for people’s decision. 'There will be a decision on Thursday and I hope there will be a Remain vote - there may will be a Remain vote, there may be a Leave vote.'He added: 'Whatever the result that is the result of the referendum; we’ve got to work with it. 'And I would say to the EU, whatever the result, we want to see better working conditions across Europe.'I want to see better environmental protection across Europe – will all suffer from these things. I want to see a trade policy that doesn’t export pollution by importing goods that have been made in a deeply polluted way.'I will be pursuing exactly the same agenda on Friday morning that I’ve put to you tonight.' Getting out the working-class Labour vote is seen as vital to the Remain camp's chances of success.But, putting himself at odds with countless Labour voters, Mr Corbyn said yesterday: 'The very principle of a single market across Europe is the free movement of people.' Asked by the BBC if there should be an upper limit on numbers flocking here, Mr Corbyn said: 'I don't think you can have one while you have the free movement of labour.' He accused Brussels of driving large numbers of EU citizens to the UK through austerity, adding: 'I think the free movement of labour means you have to balance the economy, so you have to improve living standardsthat means the European Union's appalling treatment of Greece  that is a problem. 'If you actually deliberately lower living standards and increase poverty in certain countriesyou're bound to have a flow of people looking for somewhere else to go.' Leave campaigners said he had laid bare the truth about immigration. Labour MP and Vote Leave chairman Gisela Stuart said: 'The In campaign have no answers on how we can control immigration if we stay in the EU no plan for how we will fund the NHSno plan for where we will build the extra houses  no plan to help people who will see further pressure on their pay packets.' Ex-Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said the admission there can be no upper migration limit while Britain is in the EU was 'finally some honesty from the In campaign'. Referendum campaigning was again muted today as MPs gather in Westminster to pay tribute to Jo Cox at an emergency recall of the House of Commons in the wake of her killing.A final push will begin tomorrow night when Boris Johnson takes part in the biggest live TV debate of the campaign at Wembley Arena.He will be joined by fellow Brexit campaigners Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP and Tory energy minister Andrea Leadsom - the same threesome that took part in ITV's two-hour EU debate earlier this month. They will be taking on Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan and Frances O'Grady, General Secretary of the Trade Unions Congress representing the In campaign. In his final newspaper column ahead of Thursday's vote today, Mr Johnson told readers: 'When you pick up your ballot paper this Thursday, you have it in your hands to transform Britain's current democratic arrangements for the better.'You can change the whole course of European history – and if you vote Leave, I believe that change will be overwhelmingly positive. 'If we vote Remain, we stay locked in the back of the car, driven by someone with an imperfect command of English, and going a direction we don't want to go.'Jeremy Corbyn tonight praised Angela Merkel for welcoming Syrian refugees to Europe in the midst of the migrant crisis last summer. Her decision has been heavily criticised by many European leaders and some on the right of Brexit side of Britain's referendum debate as making the refugee crisis worse by encouraging more people to make the perilous journey to the continent from the Middle East. A participant in tonight's live EU referendum debate, an audience member described the German Chancellor's decision as the 'worst error' he had ever seen in his life.It had led to the death of many refugees who had tried to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe and ended up drowning as a result of Ms Merkel's words, he said. But Mr Corbyn said Ms Merkel's action was a 'human response' and criticised the rest of Europe for failing to follow in her lead. Jeremy Corbyn (pictured) tonight praised Angela Merkel for welcoming Syrian refugees to Europe in the midst of the migrant crisis last summer'I think behind her assumption was that the rest of Europe would be prepared to play its part in providing haven for refugees,' the Labour leader said. Mr Corbyn insisted the refugee crisis needs a cross-border international response although some of the EU and its member states' handling of the situation, such as erecting barriers on borders, has been 'appalling'.He said: 'If there was no European Union and instead you had 27 member states - would there be any coordinated response? Probably not.'Would there be any route out for those refugees? Probably not.' He lashed out at Ukip leader Nigel Farage for his 'bigoted poster that depicted a line of male Syrian refugees crossing the Slovenian border during the migrant crisis in October and accused Ms Merkel of putting Europe at 'breaking point'.  Jeremy Corbyn lashed out at Ukip leader Nigel Farage for his 'bigoted poster (pictured) that depicted a line of male Syrian refugees crossing the Slovenian border during the migrant crisis in October and accused Ms Merkel of putting Europe at 'breaking point'Drawing applause from the audience, he said 'desperate' refugees pose no risk to Britain compared to the threat posed by the 'hatred' put on them by the likes of Mr Farage.'The Syrian refugees are just like all of us in this room, they are fleeing from war looking for somewhere safe to go to,' the Labour leader said.'Surely that has to be a humanitarian response, not the bigoted response of putting up a 32 sheet poster which says a group of desperate people are somehow or other a threat to us.'No, they're not, they're no threat at all.'The threat is the hatred that is put towards those people by those people that put up that poster.' Migrants should not be the scapegoat for low wages in the UK, Jeremy Corbyn told young voters tonight.Instead it was businessmen such as Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who are to blame for driving down workers' wages and accelerating the use of controversial zero-hours contracts.He appealed for voters to back staying in the EU so Britain could work with other European countries to outlaw zero-hours contracts, which do not guarantee a minimum number of hours of work a week. Migrants should not be the scapegoat for low wages in the UK, Jeremy Corbyn told young voters at a Sky News debate in West London tonight Some EU member states had already banned them, he told young voters in a Sky News Q&A debate tonight with just three days to go until the EU referendum.  Pressed on how Labour would help workers whose salaries were being driven down by migration, Mr Corbyn said: 'By ensuring that local wage rates are paid, that the minimum wage is respected, that the living wage becomes a reality, £10 an hour seems to me to be the figure that we should be campaigning for, but also to ensure there is lower levels of disparity so people don't necessarily feel so attracted to go and work elsewhere because they get better wages.'The party leader said restricting movement of labour across the EU defeated the point of the Single Market.Securing refugee status is 'very difficult' and detailed checks were carried out on anyone applying for the status,' he added.'The idea that you can just walk in a country and announce you are a refugee and get status is far, far, far from the reality of it.' Boris Johnson today warned voters have one chance to 'change the whole course of European history' by backing Brexit on Thursday.As the long-awaited referendum moves into its final hours and with the polls finely balanced, the Vote Leave champion said voters had a 'fundamental decision' to make.Mr Johnson, who was back on the stump at Ipswich firm Trucks R Us today, said the Remain campaign was offering 'nothing... but the steady and miserable erosion of Parliamentary democracy' in Britain.Leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson today warned voters they have one chance to 'change the whole course of European history' by backing Brexit on Thursday The former London Mayor took control on the campaign trail today ahead of Thursday's voteDavid Cameron last night made his final pitch to voters in a live BBC Question Time special, insisting a strong economy underpinned everything else - but he was lashed again and again over immigration.Referendum campaigning was again muted today as MPs gather in Westminster to pay tribute to Jo Cox at an emergency recall of the House of Commons in the wake of her killing.A final push will begin tomorrow night when Boris Johnson takes part in the biggest live TV debate of the campaign at Wembley Arena.In his final newspaper column before the vote, the ex-Mayor of London wrote in the Daily Telegraph: 'When you pick up your ballot paper this Thursday, you have it in your hands to transform Britain's current democratic arrangements for the better.'You can change the whole course of European history – and if you vote Leave, I believe that change will be overwhelmingly positive. 'If we vote Remain, we stay locked in the back of the car, driven by someone with an imperfect command of English, and going a direction we don't want to go.'Boris Johnson returned to the campaign trail at Ipswich firm Trucks R Us today as he urged voters to seize their chance to 'change the course of European history' by endorsing Brexit on Thursday Mr Johnson said a Remain vote would do nothing to 'rebuke the elites in Brussels' or allow Britain to set up a trade deal with America, China or India. And in a clear dismissal of Mr Cameron - who just last night insisted Britain was better in the room, at the negotiating table, Mr Johnson said: 'We are not more powerful, or more influential for being around the table in Brussels.'Look at the pitiful results of the so-called renegotiation earlier this year. We are drowned out.'And it is an illusion to think that if we vote to Remain, we are somehow opting for the status quo. 'The status quo is not on offer. If we stay in, we will be engaged willy-nilly in the desperate attempt to keep the euro together, by building an economic government of Europe.'Mr Johnson said he wanted to hand 'power back to the people' because democracy was the 'best way of correcting the errors of our people'.He said: 'Now is the time to believe in ourselves, and in what Britain can do, and to remember that we always do best when we believe in ourselves.'Of course we can continue to provide leadership and support for Europe – but inter-governmentally, outside the supranational EU system.'I hope you will vote Leave, and take back control of this great country's destiny; and if we Vote Leave, then all our votes will count for more in the future.'This chance will not come again in our lifetimes, and I pray we do not miss it.'Mr Johnson will again be joined by Labour's Gisela Stuart and Tory Andrea Leadsom when he takes to the Wembley Arena stage tomorrow night.For the Remain side, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and TUC chief Frances O'Grady.In his final live TV event last night, Mr Cameron recalled Winston Churchill as he pleaded with voters to back him on Thursday. He said: 'In my office I sit two yards away from the Cabinet Room where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler - the best and greatest decision perhaps anyone's ever made in our country, right?'He didn't want to be alone, he wanted to be fighting with the French and with the Poles and the others, but he didn't quit.'He didn't quit in Europe, he didn't quit on European democracy, he didn't quit on European freedom.'We want to fight for these things today and you can't win, you can't fight if you're not in the room. You can't win a football match if you're not on the pitch.'The Prime Minister's spirited defence of the EU came after one audience member said he was a '21st century Neville Chaberlain' for hailing the deal he negotiated with the leaders of the other 27 member states.Boris Johnson, pictured greeting workers at the truck firm today, urged voters to seize their one and only chance to quit the EU at the referendum on ThursdayDavid Cameron, pictured at the Mini factory today, recalled Winston Churchill as he pleaded with voters to back his Remain campaign on ThursdayDavid Cameron has been told by allies not to hand Boris Johnson a Cabinet job if Britain votes to stay in the EU on Thursday, it emerged today. Pro-EU ministers and MPs want him to scrap plans for a 'unity reshuffle,' insisting Brexit ministers and MPs had been disloyal by campaigning so vociferously the Prime Minister.Employment minister Priti Patel has been one of the most aggressive Out campaigners who have attacked government policy despite being a Cabinet minister herself, but Justice Secretary Michael Gove - a close friend of Mr Cameron - has not held back from criticising the Government's record.  Mr Johnson, pictured at Vote Leave's final weekend rally yesterday, said voters had the power to 'transform Britain's current democratic arrangements for the better' at Thursday's referendum Mr Johnson was tipped to be given a top job in government as a gesture to the Leave camp of the Tory party and an attempt to put the bitter infighting within the party to bed.A minister campaigning for a Remain vote on Thursday told the Daily Telegraph: 'People who backed the Prime Minister and made the case for the EU would be outraged to see people who attacked the Government getting promoted.'But failure to promote pro-Brexit Tory MPs risks causing a long-lasting rift in the party over Europe. Mr Gove is expected to keep his role in Cabinet, but other pro-Brexit Cabinet ministers are expected to be demoted in favour of younger, more loyal MPs. Chris Grayling, Leader of the House of Commons, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers could lose their jobs along with Ms Patel. Vote Leave campaigner Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, could return to Cabinet if Mr Cameron decides in favour of a unity reshuffle. However some within the party believe Mr Cameron will wait until the autumn to reshuffle his top team in order to calm tensions in the party after months of blue-on-blue civil war, which has dominated newspaper headlines and some fear done permanent damage the party's image. Employment minister Priti Patel (pictured) has been one of the most aggressive Out campaigners who have attacked government policy despite being a Cabinet minister herself, but Justice Secretary Michael Gove - a close friend of Mr Cameron - has not held back from criticising the Government's recordTory peer Baroness Warsi claimed to have switched to the Remain campMaverick Tory peer Baroness Warsi last night claimed to have switched to the Remain camp in protest over a controversial Nigel Farage immigration poster.However, her high-profile 'defection' was greeted with bafflement among Leave supporters - who could not remember her ever campaigning in their side.Lady Warsi's claims were made following a day when a Ukip poster claiming migration was pushing the continent to 'breaking point' were condemned by all sides.Last night she told The Times: 'That breaking point poster really was - for me - the breaking point to say: 'I can't go on supporting this'.She added: 'We all feel very passionately about these issues, it's when you start to believe that any means are acceptable to achieve an end. It's not an easy decision.'When I look at the people who are now saying the things they are saying and the people who are supporting that approach, the BNP, Donald Trump, Marine le Pen, Austria's Freedom Party — every day it feels like the far right is coming out to stand by Leave.' She later told the BBC: 'This kind of nudge-nudge, wink-wink xenophobic racist campaign may be politically savvy or politically useful in the short term, but it causes long-term damage to communities.'The vision that me and other Brexiters who have been involved right from the outset, who had a positive outward-looking vision of what a Brexit vote might mean, unfortunately those voices have now been stifled.'What we see is the divisive campaign which has resulted in people like me and others who are deeply Eurosceptic and want to see a reformed relationship feel that they now have to leave Leave.'But a spokesman for Vote Leave said the campaign was confused by Lady Warsi's announcement.He said: 'We don't remember Warsi ever joining our campaign so we are puzzled by her claims to have defected.'Daniel Hannan, the high profile Tory MEP and Leave campaigner, said: 'When I invited Sayeeda Warsi to join the Leave campaign, she declined. Fair enough, obviously. But how is this a 'defection'?'Tory MP Bernard Jenkin added: 'I helped set up Vote Leave and she has not been at a single meeting I have attended. ''Defects'' just not accurate!.'

Trident vote may be held this summer: Government whips keen to hold vote before summer recess to divert attention from any Tory acrimony over the referendum 2016-6-17Ministers are plotting a vote on Trident before the summer recess to try and heal splits in the Tory party after the EU referendum.Government whips are keen for a vote on Britain’s nuclear deterrent during the week before the House of Commons breaks up for the summer, on 21 July.The vote would also shift attention away from Tory acrimony to disunity in the Labour party over the renewal of Trident.The government is planning to vote on the replacement for Trident, pictured an artist's impression, before the summer parliamentary recess to reunite the Tory party which is badly split over the Brexit referendum The Labour Party is badly divided over the need to replace Trident, pictured, with a new class of submarineConservative MPs have been split over the EU referendum, with many backbenchers dismayed at the audacity of David Cameron and George Osborne in using the machinery of Whitehall to make the case for Remain.Now whips hope that a vote on the nuclear deterrent will rally Tory MPs behind the government.One senior source said: ‘They know full well that Trident is more a dividing issue for Labour than it is for the Conservatives. This will put the focus back onto splits between Jeremy Corbyn and his backbenchers.’The Labour leader is vehemently opposed to the renewal of Britain’s nuclear deterrent.But unions and many Labour MPs support it because of the jobs it creates and the safety and diplomatic clout it offers Britain.Emily Thornberry, the shadow defence secretary, has been asked by Mr Corbyn to lead a review of the party’s policy which is currently in favour of Trident.Miss Thornberry opposes the renewal of Trident and is due to report back later this month.Mr Corbyn will be forced to give his MPs a free vote to head off a massive rebellion against his leadership.Downing Street sources said no final decisions had been taken on the timing of the Trident vote.A vote on Trident would offer an opportunity to exploit Labour divisions and unify the Tory party post-Brexit.Sir Lynton Crosby, the Tory’s election mastermind, told a Westminster gathering this week that party unity was even more important than the outcome of the referendum.‘Whatever the outcome of next week's ballot, nothing is more important than the Conservative party.'The party had to 'unite to govern responsibly' he told the Policy Exchange think tank.He said it was a 'great party' full of members with 'different views' but it was 'built on the right values' and acted as a 'bulwark against the damage that Jeremy Corbyn and Labour would render' on the country.'Whatever the result next Thursday, the party must go forward in that united spirit.'It is its duty to do so in the interests of Great Britain'.The contentious Chilcot report will also be published in July and the Government is understood to want to make a final decision on another airport runway. 

Britain is great, we are all very polite (but there are too many illegal immigrants): Europeans living here have their say on Brexit vote 2016-6-21European immigrants living in London have had their say on Brexit with just two days to go before the big vote. The group, which included shop workers, musicians and academics, are concerned that business could struggle and European travel won't be as easy if the Leave side wins. But there are also fears over illegal immigration and a belief that the UK is strong enough to go it alone.For Raluca Cioroianu, freedom of movement within the European Union is not something she takes for granted.Vera Pereira, a Portuguese double bass player with a British orchestra, in Borough, London, she has concerns orchestras may not be able to tour as much if the UK leaves the EURaluca Cioroianu from Romania at the farm where she is a shop manager in Addlestone. She said she is not 'ashamed' to say that she is from Romania as the UK goes to the pollsPaolo Esposito, an Italian national working in financial services, on a footbridge over the River Thames, said British attitudes to immigrants will not change if there is a Brexit When she was growing up in communist Romania, it was difficult to travel abroad, but as an adult, after her country joined the EU, she was able to move to Britain where she has built a good life for herself.Now, with the EU vote on Thursday, Cioroianu finds it hard to understand why so many want to leave a club that gives them free access to a whole continent.Cioroianu, who works as a shop supervisor at a farm, said: 'If you were a teenager from the UK, you could just take your passport and go. We couldn't do that.'Immigration has been one of the central topics of the EU referendum debate. Those campaigning for a Leave vote say the government is powerless to control numbers arriving because of EU freedom of movement rules.'I came here with good intentions, to work, to pay taxes, to improve my knowledge, my culture, and to make a better life,' Cioroianu added. 'I'm not ashamed to say that I'm from Romania.'For Catarina Cardoso, a Portuguese academic specialising in climate change who lives in London with her German husband and three children, the EU referendum debate has made a difference to how she feels about being an immigrant.'Until now we were the same as everyone else, maybe a different accent, but it didn't seem to be an issue,' she said'Now you don't know whether you're welcome.'The family had not previously considered leaving. They like Britain and its way of life and are settled at work and at school. 'But if Britain exits the EU then I suppose we'll have to think about it,' Cardoso added.Monika Cyrek, a Polish national who works in a grocery store run by her mother selling mostly products from her homeland, also feels Brexit would make the Polish community feel less welcome. Svenja Schumacher, a German national working for a London financial services firm, near the London Eye, wants to vote in the referendum Simeon Simeonov, a Bulgarian car washer, poses for a photograph in Weybridge said people who support Leave are 'thinking like in the last century''If we're not wanted here, probably a lot of people will leave and try other places,' she said.A more urgent concern though is how a Brexit would affect the family business. 'I don't know if it will make it harder for us to bring goods from Poland,' she added.Vera Pereira, a Portuguese double bass player with a British orchestra, worries about the impact a Brexit would have on Britain's music scene, one of its main attractions for her.'Orchestras may not be able to tour as much. I'm afraid other countries in Europe won't listen to British orchestras as often and the world of music in Britain won't be as well known as it is now. In 20 years we'll see the result,' she said.Fellow musician Jessie Grimes, an Irish clarinettist, said her time playing with the EU Youth Orchestra a few years ago brought home the advantages of being part of the bloc.'Being in that orchestra made me feel quite European and understand that unity is important because we had amazing musicians from all over Europe,' she said.Monika Cyrek, a Polish national who works in a grocery store run by her mother that sells mostly Polish products, thinks a lot of immigrants will leave if the UK votes for Brexit Mihai Marcar, a Romanian waiter at a garden centre restaurant, is worried about the number of immigrants who are in the UK illegally Grimes is concerned that a post-EU Britain may have to re-instate border controls between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. 'I can't see that going peacefully,' she said, recalling the political violence that blighted Northern Ireland when she was a child.Grimes also cares about gay rights and says it would be a shame for Britain, which allows gay marriage and adoption, to lose the possibility of influencing less progressive EU nations.'You can only do good by staying,' she said.Uniquely among non-British EU nationals, Irish citizens living in Britain are allowed to vote in the referendum, and Grimes has cast her postal ballot to remain. Svenja Schumacher, a German national working for a London financial services firm, wishes she could have a say. 'I don't think it's fair that I don't have a vote. I pay taxes in Britain,' she said.She thinks that growing up in Germany made her feel a lot more European than most Britons do. 'When I was at school I had student exchanges with France, Italy, Spain. We learnt quite a few European languages. We learnt about the EU, European law, the whole set-up,' she said. 'Here the discussions you read in the press are mainly about what economic benefits Britain takes out of the EU and not what the EU stands for, things like freedom, security, solidarity.'Simeon Simeonov, a Bulgarian car cleaner, puts it more bluntly: 'They're thinking like in the last century,' he says of those campaigning for a Brexit.Catarina Cardoso, a Portuguese academic specialising in climate change who lives in London with her German husband and their three children. She said since the EU campaign began she has been concerned her family are not 'welcome' in the countryJessie Grimes, an Irish clarinettist, in west London thinks there may have to be border controls between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland if the Leave campaign winsHe came to Britain with his Bulgarian wife to give their two children a chance for a better life. His main fear about a Brexit is that it might stop them from continuing their education at a local British state school.Mihai Marcar, a Romanian waiter at a garden centre restaurant, wants to stay in Britain come what may.'As soon as I came here, I was in love with the British way of life. This 'hello, how are you? Thank you very much', it attracted me very much. This British gentleman style,' he says.Marcar has been dismayed by the negative tone of much of the debate about immigration, particularly from eastern Europe. He feels hard-working, productive people are being unfairly stigmatised because of a minority who are not like that.'I think there are a lot of people who are here illegally. For me that's the real problem, not the people who are working here, paying taxes, having a normal life.'Paolo Esposito, an Italian national working in financial services, says he has 'zero concern' about attitudes towards European residents changing in the event of a Brexit because of the welcoming, cosmopolitan character of London, where he lives.'I wasn't expecting it to be so easy to settle. From simple things like bureaucracy, which is a lot more straightforward than in Italy, to people's attitudes towards foreigners. Looking back on it, it was less hassle than changing your gym,' he says.'I'm definitely settled, with a ring, a mortgage, a British baby.'Esposito thinks there may be professional consequences from a Brexit, due to the impact on financial services and on the British economy, but says: 'If it happens, I'm sure we'll survive the storm.' 

Nigel Farage in racism storm over Brexit poster showing thousands of male refugees and warning country is at 'breaking point'2016-6-16Nigel Farage was branded 'fundamentally racist' today after he unveiled a Brexit poster showing thousands of male refugees flooding into Europe. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said his latest poster is 'disgusting' while Tory Treasury minister Harriet Baldwin hit out at the Ukip leader for 'vile xenophobia'.MPs from all main Westminster parties hit out at the ad minutes after it was unveiled by Mr Farage in Westminster this morning.   The poster uses a picture of Syrian refugees being escorted along the Slovenian border during the migrant crisis last October and tells voters the EU is at 'breaking point, adding: 'The EU has failed us all. We must break free of the EU and take control of our borders.'Ukip leader Nigel Farage unveiled the controversial poster in Westminster this morning but was immediately condemned by MPs from all main Westminster partiesScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter that Nigel Farage's latest poster is 'disgusting'It is expected to be the largest advertising campaign of the referendum so far and will be rolled out across the country today.Defending his poster amid attacks from all sides of the political spectrum, Mr Farage claimed 'all' the people pictured in the poster will have EU passports within years.  'This is a statement about the whole of the European Union and politically I really do think that the European Union is at breaking point,' he told the BBC as he unveiled the poster in Westminster. 'That is why you are seeing new parties emerging and new change happening. And I have to say something - every one of these can get to Calais. 'We know how bad our government is at defending our borders, and within a few years all of these people will have EU passports. We are much less safe as part of this European Union.' But Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and Green MPs united to condemn the poster this morning, accusing Mr Farage of 'exploiting the misery of the Syrian refugee crisis in the most dishonest and immoral way'. The poster (pictured being driven around Westminster this morning, is expected to be the largest advertising campaign of the referendum so far and will be rolled out across the country todayTory MP Neil Carmichael, who is campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU, said: 'It's disappointing to see Ukip jumping on the refugee crisis to further their own political aims.'Britain can only deal with the issue of immigration by working together with European countries that face the same challenges. 'Distasteful propaganda like this can only make our immigration challenges worse, not better, and damage community cohesion in Britain.' Labour's Yvette Cooper said the poster was irresponsible and said all European countries had a moral duty to help with the migration crisis. 'Ripping up cooperation with the EU would make it much harder to stop the people smugglers, help refugees or prevent illegal migration,' she said. 'No country can cope with something like this alone.' Attacking Mr Farage, Ms Cooper said: 'Just when you thought leave campaigners couldn't stoop any lower, they are now exploiting the misery of the Syrian refugee crisis in the most dishonest and immoral way. 'Europe didn't cause the Syrian refugee crisis and pulling out of the EU won't stop people fleeing conflict and persecution by ISIS and the Assad regime.' The picture used by Ukip in its latest Brexit poster is from a photo taken from the Slovenian border in OctoberLabour MP Paula Sherriff and SNP MP John Nicolson both hit out at Nigel Farage's latest poster today Meanwhile a rival campaign poster supporting Britain staying in the EU mocked up Nigel Farage as a government minister and warned: 'Don't wake up with Nigel next Friday'. It echoed Conservative party election posters used in last year's General Election warning. With just a week until voters finally have their say in the referendum, another poll showed Brexit ahead this morning. The Ipsos Mori survey put the Leave campaign six points ahead of the Remain camp and matched a string of polls over the past week to have shown big leads for Leave.The details of today's opinion poll made grim reading for the Remain campaign.Fewer than one in five people believe the main Treasury campaign claim that households would be £4,300 after a Brexit vote.By contrast, almost half of people do believe the controversial Leave campaign figure that Britain would get back control of £350million a week after Brexit.Today's poster signals another high profile intervention from Mr Farage after he was caught up in an extraordinary clash with Sir Bob Geldof on the Thames yesterday.In the most bizarre scenes of the EU referendum so far, the Ukip leader took to the waves with dozens of fishing boats as he urged a vote to cut ties with Brussels next week.But they were greeted by boats carrying Remain supporters including the rock star, and loud speakers blasting out the song 'In With the In Crowd'.Nigel Farage unveils his latest Brexit poster in Westminster but MPs from all main Westminster parties immediately condemned it Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (right) said Nigel Farage's latest poster is 'disgusting' A rival campaign poster supporting Britain staying in the EU mocked up Nigel Farage as a government minister and warned: 'Don't wake up with Nigel next Friday' The fleets chased each other along the river for several hours - while at one point hoses were deployed by the trawlers to try to settle the argument. Speaking after the PR stunt, Mr Farage hinted he could quit politics if the country backs Brexit next week - although he refused to rule out taking a seat in the Lords.The Ukip leader said that despite the encouraging polls, the Leave camp were 'a very long way' from winning the referendum on June 23.Asked about his plans after the vote, he said: 'I might go and get a real job, you never know.'Mr Farage, speaking to reporters on a boat on the Thames as part of the Fishing for Leave flotilla, said: 'I haven't thought about it. Everything in my career in politics has been about next Thursday, everything.'Mr Farage has curtailed his drinking, although he smoked cigarettes during the voyage on the Thames yesterday and joked: 'I think the doctors have got it wrong about smoking.'Asked whether he would serve in a post-Brexit government with Boris Johnson in charge, he said: 'I want to win next Thursday. God knows what comes afterwards, who know what happens to the Tory party afterwards?'Who knows what happens to the Labour Party afterwards, to Ukip?'Asked whether he would rule out taking a seat in the Lords, he said: 'I wouldn't rule in or rule out anything after next Thursday, including quitting politics altogether.' Boris Johnson today denied he was bidding to become Prime Minister in the aftermath of the referendum as another poll showed Vote Leave was six points clear.With just one week until the historic referendum finally takes place, the latest survey matched a string of polls over the past week to have shown big leads for Leave.Despite the Remain campaign scrambling to halt an apparent slide in support, the new snapshot of public opinion by Ipsos-Mori indicated the momentum continued to be with Brexit supporters.On a visit to a fish firm in Lowestoft, Suffolk, the ex-mayor of London gutted a fish for the cameras before dismissing suggestions he could be in No 10 within weeks.The latest row came as another poll showed Brexit six points ahead with just one week to go until the June 23 referendumBoris Johnson went in search of inspiration today as he was told he should be prime minister on a campaign visit to a fish firm in Suffolk today David Cameron - due to campaign in Gibraltar today - is widely expected to announce his resignation if today's poll for the Evening Standard is borne out at the ballot boxOn his visit, Mr Johnson declared 'they're pinching our fish' as he posed for photos while holding a live lobster, before then attempting to fillet a salmon.Speaking at the Sam Cole Food Group to people involved in the fishing industry, Mr Johnson said he is campaigning for Britain to 'take back control' of its waters and ensure North Sea fish is more fairly distributed.The former London mayor said: 'We think we'd get more boats coming to Lowestoft.'He added: 'We hope that carries your core support.'John Knights, who has a fishing boat in Lowestoft docks, said: 'As long as you end up prime minister.'But Mr Johnson replied: 'No, that's not going to happen.'Speaking after Mr Johnson's visit, Mr Knights added: 'I'm really worried about this country.'Asked if he hopes Mr Johnson would be PM if the UK leaves the EU, Mr Knights replied: 'Yeah I do. That man in charge - he's got a pair of balls.'I don't think he knows much about the (fishing) job, but I believe he really does care about Britain and I believe the man has got some guts to run this country - not just the fishing.'This country is getting in a mess.'Mr Johnson grappled with a live lobster on his visit to the fish factory to make a rallying cry to protect the fishing industry by voting for Brexit next weekMr Johnson, who was joined by Conservative ministers Penny Mordaunt and George Eustice, was also presented with a 'Save Our Soles' T-shirt.He joked: 'You've got to make sure you don't say that too fast.'The T-shirt also says: 'EU destroyed our fishing industry - vote leave.'The details of today's opinion poll made grim reading for the Remain campaign.Fewer than one in five people believe the main Treasury campaign claim that households would be £4,300 after a Brexit vote.By contrast, almost half of people do believe the controversial Leave campaign figure that Britain would get back control of £350million a week after Brexit.Both numbers have been dismissed by independent experts but the gulf in trust between the two campaigns will send new shudders through the Remain camp. In other findings, Ipsos-Mori found more people think they would be better off in five years after Brexit than if Britain stays in.Immigration is now the most important issue to voters seven days out - a sharp turn around from earlier in the campaign when the economy dominated.  

Michael Gove hints he could QUIT the government if we don't vote for Brexit in the EU referendum 2016-6-21Michael Gove has hinted that he will quit government if voters do not back Brexit in the EU referendum this week.The Justice Secretary, one of the leading Leave campaigners, said he would 'reflect' on the result before deciding his future.The prospect of the Cabinet minister voluntarily departing was raised as he again attacked David Cameron over his failure to curb immigration.Mr Gove, a close friend of the Prime Minister, argued that cutting ties with Brussels was the only way of regaining control over our borders. Michael Gove gave a broad hint during an interview today that a Remain vote on Thursday would mean he leaves governmentBut he also rejected criticism that the Tories manifesto for the general election had been a 'lie' amid claims David Cameron was told by civil servants four years ago that a key immigration pledge could not be met within the bloc.Asked about his future during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Gove said: 'I will do exactly as the Prime Minister asks me.'I want people to concentrate not on my job but on their jobs. Of course, depending on what the result is on Friday, I will reflect and I will decide what is the best course for me.'Mr Gove also suggested the Conservative manifesto pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands was undermining trust in politics.He said he had stood by the plan because he hoped the Prime Minister would have been able to secure a deal with the EU on free movement that made it achievable.He said: 'Making promises and then saddling yourself with a political system and a political union that means that you cannot deliver those promises, I fear, doesn't contribute to an atmosphere of trust and confidence in politics.'Former Downing Street policy guru Steve Hilton has claimed officials told Mr Cameron four years ago that his immigration target was 'impossible' while Britain is in the EU.The civil servants said 'directly and explicitly' that the net migration goal was not deliverable given EU freedom of movement rules.Despite this, the Prime Minister has repeatedly restated his ambition to hit the target – even including it in his 2015 general election manifesto. At no stage has he succeeded in cutting net migration to below 100,000.Mr Cameron denied the claims today and insisted that when Mr Hilton left government in 2012 immigration was falling and was close to the target. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Hilton recalls the warning to Mr Cameron, saying: 'We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it.' But Mr Cameron told ITV this morning: 'It's simply not right. Actually when Steve Hilton left Downing Street in 2012, net immigration had actually fallen quite substantially and it got down to 154,000, so not far away from the ambition that I set. Mr Gove denied the claims meant the Tory manifesto had been a 'lie'.'I believed and hoped that we would be able to secure a deal with Europe which would enable us to amend free movement,' he said.He said he had 'consistently argued' that the UK needed to change its relationship with the European Union.He said: 'I have specifically argued that we need to change our relationship with the European Union by fundamentally reforming not just our relationship but the European Union itself.'During the renegotiation I hoped and prayed that the Prime Minister would be able to bring about that change.'He wasn't and I don't blame him - I do blame the other countries of Europe.' Mr Cameron tried to move on from the row over immigration levels today by delivering a plea to older voters in Downing Street.The PM admitted he had made mistakes in government - but urged people not to punish him by sending Britain out of the EU. He said the economic case for staying in was 'paramount'.Boris Johnson today said he would apologise publicly if Brexit caused a recession but insisted Britain had nothing to fear from quitting the EU.David Cameron pleaded with voters not to punish him for mistakes in government by sending Britain crashing out of the EUThe ex-London Mayor has rejected an economic consensus which has strongly warned against voting for Brexit on Thursday.Mr Cameron and George Osborne made the extraordinary claim in the middle of the campaign that Britain would be voting for a 'DIY recession' if it backed Brexit.Treasury forecasts suggest anything from a mild to a severe recession is possible after a Brexit vote - but found now evidence for the possibility Brexit would provoke growth because of the uncertainty it would cause.Mr Johnson was challenged today during a live radio interview on whether he would be 'humble' enough to apologise if he won the referendum but proved to be wrong about the economy.Answering questions on LBC, the Vote Leave champion said: 'Of course I will.'He added: 'This is far more important any individual political career or politician. I don't think that London has anything to fear from coming out of the EU, this is the most extraordinary economy, and nor does Britain.'Britain is the fifth biggest economy in the world, we have the opportunity to do new trade deals.'When has our country ever gone wrong in believing in ourselves or our democratic institutions?'Pressed again on an apology, Mr Johnson said: 'I've always been pretty humble about everything.'I think the current gloom is actually being induced by Project Fear and the nonsense coming from the Remain campaign - I think they are talking the country down.'

Don't panic! What WILL happen if we Brexit? Leave Minister CHRIS GRAYLING has this soothing advice2016-6-19It's been a sombre few days for politics. The tragic death of Jo Cox has shocked everyone in Parliament and in the referendum campaigns. All our prayers are with her family.But even in the face of this terrible news, on Thursday the country will take the biggest decision for a generation.What happens next if, by Friday morning, Britain has narrowly voted to leave the EU?Chris Grayling: If Britain votes to leave the EU, the first thing is that there is no need to panic. Nothing changes the day after and until the formal leaving process is overThe real answer lies with the Prime Minister and the Government. But as Leave campaigners, we must give some answers too.The first thing is that there is no need to panic. Nothing changes the day after and until the formal leaving process is over.The commonly accepted way to leave is in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the document governing the EU. We give notice and then have two years to agree our future relationship. After that, we leave automatically unless we and our partners agree to take longer.So the starting point should be a period of informal preparation. The Prime Minister should set up the negotiating team, preferably with a cross-party element.He should have informal talks with other EU leaders. We should state clearly that while we will leave the EU, we will remain co-operative neighbours and continue to work side by side in organisations such as Nato.The Prime Minister’s position remains immensely important. It’s why I have always said he must stay on in the event of a Brexit vote.He will play a vital role in maintaining stability in the markets, and his personal relationships with other EU leaders will be invaluable. Then the formal process begins.The first priority is talks on trade. Other EU countries may be upset, but they will come round in the end.The Prime Minister’s position remains immensely important. It’s why I have always said he must stay on in the event of a Brexit voteMoney and jobs are always a priority for politicians, and we are their biggest customer. European businesses will want to retain free-trade access to the UK – their biggest export market.One in five cars built in Germany is sold here. Thousands of French farmers produce food for the UK.In the end, it will be in everyone’s interests to agree a free-trade relationship. The formal period for the exit talks is two years. There is no reason why this should be difficult.It may have taken seven years for the EU and Canada to reach a trade deal. But they had to negotiate new industrial standards and rules.We have no such issues. UK businesses already conform to EU standards. The deal can be done quickly.Then there will be changes to our laws, for example the scrapping of the Act of Parliament that took us into the EU.At the end of all of this, people will still holiday in Spain or travel round Europe.Airlines will fly as normal. You’ll still buy French cheese or Italian wine. Roaming charges will continue to disappear.London will remain a great cosmopolitan city. Companies will still sell their products to people around Europe, as they do now.But from the moment we leave, our £350 million a week EU subscription stops, giving us extra cash for priorities such as the NHS.We take back control of our laws and Britain will be a proud independent nation again.Chris Grayling is Conservative MP for Epsom and Ewell, and the Leader of the Commons.

Illegal immigrants aiming to cross the Channel say Brexit will make it EASIER to sneak into Britain because France will no longer try to stop them 2016-6-24Migrants living in the jungle refugee camp in Paris have praised the Brexit vote claiming French authorities will no longer block their passage to Britain. French politicians reacted angrily to the referendum result, with the Mayor of Calais seeking the removal of the controversial refugee camp claiming the British government should deal with the situation. Asylum seekers make nightly attempts to sneak on board trucks looking to cross the Channel, but are often intercepted by French police. Migrants living in the Jungle Camp in Calais believe Brexit will make it easier to sneak into the UK French politicians want to abandon an agreement where UK border checks are carried out in Calais One Afghan asylum seeker told the Mirror: 'Everything is very tough now, they don’t let people go to the UK. But if the UK is out of the EU, France is going to say, "Bye bye, you are out, now take your refugees".'Currently border checks are conducted on the French side of the Channel with many migrants living in the infamous Jungle camp.But now the the understanding, known as the Touquet agreement, between France and the UK has been called into question following Britain's vote to leave the European Union.And mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart says she will be pressing for the agreement to be suspended.She told French broadcaster BFM TV: 'The British must take on the consequences of their choice.Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart, who says migrant camps in the French port town should to be moved to Britain after a vote in favour of Brexit'We are in a strong position to push, to press this request for a review and we are asking the President to bring his weight (to the issue).'We must put everything on the table and there must be an element of division, of sharing.'This echoed calls from Xavier Bertrand, the centre-right president of the Hauts-de-France region, who tweeted: 'The English wanted to take back their freedom, they must take back their border.'Prior to the referendum, a French government minister had warned a vote for Brexit could see migrant camps being moved from Calais to Britain.Finance minister Emmanuel Macron said in February that the treaty, which was signed in 2003, could be scuppered, telling reporters: 'The day this relationship unravels, migrants will no longer be in Calais.'There are currently around 7,000 migrants camped in Calais and Dunkirk, many of whom make regular attempts to get into the Channel Tunnel or board a ferry.Ending the agreement would mean cars and lorries would not be checked for migrants until they reach the British side of the Channel.However, previously Bernard Cazeneuve, the French Interior Minister, rubbished suggestions the border with Britain could be opened.'Calling for the border with the English to be opened is not a responsible solution,' Mr Cazeneuve said.Before the vote, a French government minister had warned Brexit could lead to the camps moving to EnglandEnding the agreement would mean  vehciles would not be checked for migrants until they reach DoverThere are currently around 7,000 migrants camped in Calais and Dunkirk seeking to sneak into the UK 'It would send a signal to people smugglers and would lead migrants to flow to Calais in far greater numbers.'A humanitarian disaster would ensue. It is a foolhardy path, and one the government will not pursue.'On the contrary, we're going to make the border even more watertight to dissuade smugglers and migrants, respect international rules and reduce the pressure on Calais.'Britain and France signed the Le Touquet treaty in 2003 amid tensions over the number of people in campsBritain and France signed the Le Touquet treaty in 2003 amid tensions over the number of people in camps at Calais.The deal was the latest in a series that allowed Britain to carry out border checks on the French side of the Channel - meaning papers were checked there and vehicles inspected.British officials are based on the French side of the channel and cooperation around the eurotunnel terminal was stepped up last summer as the numbers trying to break into the tunnel grew.Scrapping the deal could see British border checks brought back to the English side of the Channel - potentially allowing people to reach the Kent shore to set up camp while awaiting processing.There are currently around 7,000 people at the camps with 'roads' handed British-styled names such as Queen Elizabeth II Street. 

Cuts start on Friday if we leave claims scaremonger Osborne: Jobs losses will be 'very quick' and cash will flee UK, he says 2016-6-21George Osborne last night suggested that workers could start losing their jobs as soon as Friday morning if Britain votes for Brexit on Thursday.In an extraordinary escalation of the scaremongering, the Chancellor warned that people could begin losing their jobs ‘very quickly’ as a result of the ‘economic shock’.Ramping up Project Fear over the economy, he also refused to rule out suspending trading on the London stock market if Britons voted to leave the EU.Scroll down for video Fear factor: George Osborne at McLaren. He suggested that workers could start losing their jobs as soon as Friday morning if Britain votes for Brexit on ThursdayAsked in an LBC radio interview about whether redundancies warned of by banks such as JP Morgan could come as early as Friday, Mr Osborne said: ‘That will start to happen very quickly, sadly.’He then warned of a flight of money out of the UK if Britons vote to leave.He said: ‘On Friday morning you will see the first reaction in the financial markets because they’ve placed all these bets that they will move money out of Britain if Britain votes to Leave.’Bosses of 100 small and medium-sized firms have signed a letter urging voters to back Brexit.They say they are held back by EU red tape. Traders who signed the letter, published by The Sun, range from shopkeepers to butchers and interior designers. They argue the ‘ideals of the EU are no longer in the best interests of British business or the British people’.The letter states: ‘We run some of the five million small businesses that form the backbone of this country. We believe Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and the Brexit camp are right that we must vote to leave the EU on June 23. When we voted to join Europe in 1975 it was on the basis that the EEC was a trading agreement. Today’s EU is no longer just a trading agreement. It is a project aimed at creating a massive political and economic union. We believe many of the ideals of the EU are not in the best interests of British business or the British people.’The traders add: ‘Small and medium-sized businesses are constantly held back by unnecessary EU regulations and red tape. We need the freedom to be able to thrive in the 21st century, to trade with other emerging nations and to create jobs for people in our local areas.’One of the signatories, Catherine Stanley, 41, of Pinnacle Arts and Crafts in Plymouth, Devon, said: ‘I believe it would be easier for people to flourish without all the EU red tape.’Asked by presenter Iain Dale whether, if the financial markets plummeted on Friday, he would he consider suspending trading on the stock market, Mr Osborne did not rule it out.The Chancellor responded: ‘Well look, the Bank of England and the Treasury – Governor Carney and myself – we have of course discussed contingency plans.‘But the sensible thing is to keep those secret and make sure you are well prepared for whatever happens but if you set them all out in advance then you rather undermine the power of those plans.’Pushed again on the contingency plans, Mr Osborne said: ‘I have a responsibility to the people listening to this programme to do all I can to protect them. But I have to tell you that you cannot in the end protect people from the economic shock that leaving the EU would bring about.’He refused to reveal how many Treasury civil servants were working on the issue – but said they were focusing on plans for the immediate aftermath of a Brexit vote.Mr Osborne stressed that in the longer term there was ‘no plan’ for what would happen after Britain left the EU. He added: ‘We have not got plans for what you then do.’The Chancellor predicted there would be no answer for ‘years and years’ to come, adding: ‘It’s not for me to come up with [Leave’s] plan.’He also pointed to warnings from the London Stock Exchange that there would be 100,000 job losses in the City after a Brexit.And during a visit yesterday to the headquarters of supercar maker McLaren in Woking, Surrey, Mr Osborne told staff that businesses such as theirs could be hit if Britain leaves the EU.His comments came as ten Nobel Prize winners were compared to the economists who opposed Margaret Thatcher’s economic reforms after they made a plea to British voters to stay in the EU.The senior economists, hailing from the US, Greece and France as well as Britain, said yesterday that they believe the UK will be ‘better off economically’ inside the EU. In an extraordinary escalation of the scaremongering, the Chancellor warned that people could begin losing their jobs ‘very quickly’ as a result of the ‘economic shock’In an open letter, they say Brexit would create ‘major uncertainty’, with effects which would persist ‘for many years’. Signed by Cambridge professor Sir James Mirrlees and nine other winners of the Nobel Prize for economics, the letter claims economic issues are ‘central’ to the referendum debate.But Leave campaigners pointed out that economists have often been wrong before, most notably the example of the letter written to the Times in 1981 by 364 economists about the Thatcher reforms.Yesterday’s letter came as former bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury’s, M&S, Asda, Waitrose, Morrisons and B&Q warned that families would face higher prices if Britain leaves the EU.Research by retail union USDAW claimed that, if the UK were to leave, the fall in the value of sterling and the imposition of tariffs would increase prices for families by £580 a year.

Visa headaches, a plummeting dollar and turmoil for the economy: What the Brexit would mean for Australia2016-6-23As Britons and Commonwealth citizens living in the UK head to the polls on June 23 to decide if Britain remains in the European Union, the impacts could be wide-ranging for Australians.More than 46 million people are reportedly registered to vote in Thursday's plebiscite, which will ask 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?'The polls are open until 10pm local time (7am AEST), with the results due early on Friday 24 June. Scroll down for video  Britons and Commonwealth citizens currently living in the UK head to the polls on June 23 to decide if Britain remains in the European UnionBritish Prime Minister David Cameron (right) and wife Samantha Cameron (left) pictured leaving Methodist Central Hall in Westminster after voting in the referendumAbout 113,000 Australians currently living in the UK are eligible to vote in the referendum and Aussies in London organiser Teaghan Searing said they could be leaning towards a Brexit. The Facebook page she runs has 33,000 followers and she said a suggestion that a Brexit could lead to closer ties with Commonwealth countries appear to have struck a chord with members.'Just from the posts and conversations between members there is definitely this belief that leaving will lead to more open borders for Australians to come here,' she said.'There is this school of thought with some Australians that a vote for Brexit will make it easier in terms of visas and immigration for Commonwealth countries.'Voters wait for a polling station to open in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, a seaside town in North Yorkshire, EnglandMs Searing said even her friends in Australia were saying vote Brexit so they could come to the UK.  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned Britain leaving the European Union would be a 'very big shock'.  'There will be obviously great efforts to ensure that the consequences of that shock are minimised,' he said.However, Mr Turnbull said the strategic implications would not be as severe - as Britain would not be leaving NATO.Shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said a 'Brexit' would lead Britain to look more inward and force it to renegotiate trade agreements with other countries.'For Australian companies that use Britain as an entry point to the EU it would also generate disruption," Dr Leigh told AAP on Thursday.  But what kind of impact would Brexit have on Australia?People pictured queuing outside a polling station in Clapham South, London. More than 46 million people are reportedly registered to vote in Thursday's plebisciteA polling station outside the Greenwich Heritage Centre in London. The polls are open until 10pm local time (7am AEST), with the results due early on Friday 24 June Visas IF BRITAIN LEAVES THE EU If Britain separates from the EU an extra visa may be required for Australians, according to tourism expert from the University of Technology Sydney Dr David Bierman, reported The Courier Mail.Dr Bierman said if Australians travel through Britain they get automatic entrance to all other EU countries, and the same occurs for example if you travel through France and then into the UK.  'If Brexit does occur, all that will mean is you’ll have a special stamp for coming into the UK and another stamp for EU countries,' Dr Bierman said.He said it's also possible that fewer Australian travellers would visit the EU and the UK.Dr Bierman said most Australian travellers tend to base themselves in the UK and travel back and forth to the EU. Brexit would make it easier for Australians to live and work in the UK if Britain adopts the Australian points-based system of immigration for European citizens Australians moving to and living in the UKIF BRITAIN LEAVES THE EU Brexit would make it easier for Australians to live and work in the UK if Britain adopts the Australian points-based system of immigration for European citizens.Australians are currently deported from the UK if they earn below £35,000 ($70,000) a year, as part of the UK government's attempt to curb migrant numbers, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.Under the Australian system, applicants are required to meet a certain criteria of points relating to age, education, English competency and occupation. The proposed change in the UK would mean that many citizens from EU countries such as Romania and Bulgaria would no longer be automatically allowed to live and work in the country. Vote Leave campaigners, former London Mayor Boris Johnson and Cabinet Minster Michael Gove, have said if they win the referendum, they plan to introduce the system by the next general election, due in 2020.  Australians commonly work in the UK as nurses and teachers, earning a median wage of £23.019 ($46,000) which means under the new rules they would be kicked out of the country. Under the Brexit plans, migrants coming from the EU to work or study would be assessed on the basis of their skills and admitted only if Britain had identified a shortage in a particular industry.The new arrivals would also be required to speak a good level of English. IF BRITAIN REMAINS IN THE EUIf Britain remains in the EU, Australians living and working in the UK will have to deal with recent tighter restrictions on wages.They currently have to earn more than £35,000 ($70,000) a year to remain in the UK on a working holiday visa.Australians staying longer than six months in the UK will also have to continue to pay $400 (200 GBP) for the 'free' National Health Service (NHS), introduced in April this year, reported the ABC.Under Brexit the Australian dollar could fall 2.5 per cent against the US dollar and rise up to 8.3 per cent against the British PoundThe Brexit is derived from the words 'British' and 'exit' and refers to the possible departure of Britain from the European Union. Britons and Commonwealth citizens living in the UK at the time of the vote are being asked the question: 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?'Why leave?The Leave campaign argues that membership in the EU costs the UK billions of pounds that could be spent in the UK. Another key issue is the desire to better control Britain's borders.Why stay?It would be harder for Europeans to invest in the UK, more expensive for British companies to borrow and more complicated for companies with operations across the continent. The UK could still negotiate an exit with access to the EU market that doesn't have huge limitations. The uncertainty over would happen next could also hit financial markets hard. Source: Business Insider Australia Currency and the exchange rateIF BRITAIN LEAVES THE EU According to the Commonwealth Bank's Global Market Research, the British Pound could fall up to ten per cent against the US Dollar.The Australian dollar could fall 2.5 per cent against the US dollar and rise up to 8.3 per cent against the British Pound.Australians who are planning a trip to the UK should wait until after the referendum to purchase pounds, but based on the analysis they should purchase US dollars as soon as possible. IF BRITAIN REMAINS IN THE EU Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joe Capurso told The Guardian the value of the Australian dollar won't be affected in the long term unless people believe the global economy will be hit significantly by the change.Mr Capurso said if Britain remains in the EU the Australian dollar could rise about 1-2c on Friday.  SuperannuationIF BRITAIN LEAVES THE EU As superannuation is a long-term investment, volatile markets caused by a possible Brexit would mean little in the overall scheme of things, reported The Courier Mail.Super funds generally invest across shares, property, infrastructure, cash, fixed interest and alternative investments which means one bad asset would not destroy an entire super fund.If Brexit goes ahead super funds would likely be subdued for several years amid low global growth and low interest rates.Short-term turmoil in the British or European financial markets would only directly affect a small part of a super fund's assets.  Short-term turmoil in the British or European financial markets would only directly affect a small part of an Australian super fund's assets Share market and tradeIF BRITAIN LEAVES THE EU Financial markets are often spooked by uncertainty and the possibility of Britain leaving the EU would lead to turmoil in the UK and the global financial markets. In a worst case scenario it could precipitate another financial crisis, reported The Conversation.As Australia is closely linked to offshore markets, the turmoil would have a large impact on Australian markets, as they tend to decline as uncertainty increases overseas.If the markets seize up as they did in 2008, the big Australian banks would find it difficult to secure offshore funding they require, therefore share prices would fall and government guarantees could be required again.In this scenario, it would be unlikely that Australia would avoid a recession like it did in 2008-2009.A fall in the pound would also have a negative consequences for Australians who have pensions and other assets in the UK.A shaky global economy would also impact Australia's trade, with exports a key driver of recent GDP growth, so this could have a severe consequences for employment and economic growth. IF BRITAIN REMAINS IN THE EU If Britain votes to stay as part of the EU the British pound could jump by as much as six per cent against the Australian dollar, reported Business Insider Australia.Stocks are reprotedly set to rise rapidly on a Remain vote, with Barclays and Ryanair predicted to be the big winners in the UK, according to research by Macquarie.  The possibility of Britain leaving the EU would lead to turmoil in the UK and the global financial markets, directly affecting the Australian market BusinessIF BRITAIN LEAVES THE EU The June 23 vote has many implications for Australian businesses, as the UK is the second largest destination for Australian foreign investment behind the United States, reported the ABC.Australian companies such as Westfield, AMP and the Future Fund all have major investments in UK assets including shopping centres, utilities and airports.Many Australian firms also use England as a stepping stone into Europe.Australian British Chamber of Commerce chief executive David McCredie said if there was a challenge to the connectivity between the UK and the continent and Ireland, then it may challenge that perspective for Australian investors looking at Europe. Some Australian companies are reportedly worried that a vote for Britain to leave the EU could make it more difficult for them to trade in Europe as well. IF BRITAIN REMAINS IN THE EUAustralian businesses will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief. If Britain remains in the EU in the short-term, a 'relief rally' would likely see global stock markets surge higher along with the British pound (and the Australian dollar) reported The Conversation.

Today is OUR D-Day, says Gove: He issues passionate plea not to let down future generations2016-6-22Michael Gove today declares that Britain is facing this generation's 'D-Day'– with a choice between becoming a prosperous, sovereign nation once again, or a poorer, less secure one inside the EU.In the most passionate plea of the campaign, the Justice Secretary urges the public not to 'flinch' or let down future generations whose lives would be diminished by Brussels.Rejecting the pessimism of the Remain camp, led by David Cameron, he told the Mail: This is D-Day. It's democracy day. It is an opportunity for us to demonstrate a vote of confidence in our country and its ingenuity, its generosity, its tolerance and its potential.Michael Gove (pictured) has urged the public not to 'flinch' or let down future generations whose lives would be diminished by Brussels'We have got to have confidence in our institutions. Britain gave the world parliamentary democracy. It gave the world common law traditions, trial by jury and the principle of innocent until proven guilty.'We gave the world moral leadership in the fight against slavery and the fight against fascism.'We gave the world the NHS and public service broadcasting and we did all these things as a self-governing democracy.'So the idea that Britain is a rain soaked little island where we eat too much cake – that is just not right. Voting to leave is a rejection of pessimism and an embrace of optimism.'Speaking on a final campaign visit to Dorset, Mr Gove said this was Britain's opportunity to 'break free'. He continued: 'If we do not vote to leave tomorrow, then we won't get the chance to escape the EU for another generation and possibly in our lifetime.'And if we vote to stay, the European elites will take that as a vote of confidence in their leadership and a vote for more Europe.'More of the same surrender of powers, more of the same lack of control over our money, more of the same lack of democracy.'I just think it would be difficult to explain to our children and grandchildren that when we had the opportunity to show confidence in our democracy, that we decided to flinch at the last moment.'Boris Johnson gives a thumbs up as he leaves Selby, North Yorkshire, on a hectic day of campaigningMr Johnson has appealed for voters to make the EU referendum Britain's 'Independence Day'Mr Gove, who confirmed he would be happy to serve in Mr Cameron's Cabinet once the rancorous referendum contest is over, compared the moment Britain stands at in history with the American Revolution.He said: 'The decision the American Revolutionaries had to make in the 1770s about whether or not to continue to be ruled by someone who was distant and unaccountable, who imposed taxes without listening to their voices or whether to break free.'They decided to break free then and America has never looked back and the world had cause to be grateful. There will have been all sorts of people then I imagine saying it is a risk, don't go against the Establishment, can you really survive?'In five years' time, if we stay in the EU, we will be paying more money to bail out a single currency which is failing. We face the prospect of more EU control over our security, our intelligence services having their hands tied.'We face the prospect of a rogue European Court making it more difficult for us to deal with terrorism. We also face the prospect of our competitiveness diminishing. My fear is that if we vote to stay in, Britain will be poorer, less safe. I also worry that it will feel and be less fair because the elites and the establishment will have felt they had a great escape.'They will feel that the moment they could have been held to account and we could have taken control has passed.'David Cameron made his final pitch to voters in Birmingham, appearing with Gordon Brown and leading politicians from across the political spectrum at an end of campaign rallyOn an extraordinary final day. Boris Johnson criss-crossed the country by helicopter. He said: 'It's time to speak up for democracy, and hundreds of millions of people around Europe agree with us. It's time to break away from the failing and dysfunctional EU system.'Last night, the Remain camp released statements from Mr Cameron and Britain's three surviving former prime ministers urging the country to vote In.Mr Cameron said: 'Today we have assembled the biggest coalition of support in history – from businesses, to trade unions to expert economists and across political parties – for a vote to remain. Quitting Europe is a risk to your family's future because a vote to leave on Thursday means there is no going back on Friday.'In what was described as an 'unprecedented alliance', the Prime Minister was backed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from the Labour side. Mr Blair said: 'Britain faces a historic choice between prosperity, influence and security as part of Europe, or a reckless leap in the dark and years of damaging uncertainty. If we vote to leave, there is no going back. Voting Remain will secure Britain's place as a proud, influential country with a strong economy and a bright future.Appearing alongside Mr Cameron in Bristol, Sir John Major said the Brexit camp were 'the gravediggers of our prosperity'.But Defence Minister Penny Mordaunt hit out at the Remain camp for suggesting those voting for Brexit were 'little islanders'. She said: 'It is unfair to tar the millions of people who want to take back control of their laws, their borders and their money with a brush of calling them narrow minded or little islanders or all the other insults thrown at them.'That is quite wrong. This is an attempt to make people feel guilty about what they know in their hearts and their heads is the right thing for them and their families and it is a sign that they have lost the arguments.'Gove 'lost it' with Nazi jibe, says CameronDavid Cameron accused Michael Gove of having 'lost it' yesterday after the Justice Secretary compared economists warning against Brexit to Nazi-paid scientists who smeared Albert Einstein.Mr Gove said: 'We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his theories were denounced and one of the reasons, of course, he was denounced was because he was Jewish.' He told LBC radio: 'They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said, 'Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough'.'Mr Gove had been trying to highlight the public's dissatisfaction with propaganda unleashed on voters by 'experts' before today's referendum. He later apologised.David Cameron accused Michael Gove of having 'lost it' yesterday after the Justice Secretary compared economists warning against Brexit to Nazi-paid scientists who smeared Albert EinsteinBut the Prime Minister attacked Mr Gove's remarks, telling Sky News: 'To hear the Leave campaign today sort of comparing independent experts and economists to Nazi sympathisers – I think they have rather lost it.'These people are independent – economists who have won Nobel prizes, business leaders responsible for creating thousands of jobs, institutions that were set up after the war to try to provide independent advice. It is right to listen.'Mr Gove pointed out that he had refrained from personal attacks, and said: 'I was asked a question by Iain Dale [LBC presenter] about the predictions of doom for the economy. I answered, as I often do, with a historical analogy. It was clumsy and inappropriate.'Obviously I did not mean to imply anything about the motives of those who have spoken out in favour of staying in the EU.'He added: 'I'm sorry for speaking so clumsily and apologise for giving offence… I think Britain will be more prosperous if we end our connection to the euro project and I should have answered this question directly.'Nearly half PM's business advisers refuse to back the EUAlmost half of David Cameron's inner-circle of business advisers and half of Britain's FTSE 100 bosses refused to sign a letter backing Brussels, it emerged yesterday.In a letter to The Times, orchestrated by Downing Street, some 1,285 business leaders – including 900 small and medium-sized companies and 50 of the FTSE 100 – warned that leaving the EU would 'mean uncertainty for our firms, less trade with Europe and fewer jobs'.Signatories included Sir Richard Branson, of Virgin, Michael Bloomberg, the American media mogul and former New York mayor, and bosses from Barclays, mining giant Anglo American and housebuilders Barratt Developments and the Berkeley Group.But bosses of half the FTSE 100 companies – including the supermarket giant Tesco and Britain's biggest bank Lloyds – refused requests from the Remain campaign to put their name to the letter.And in a bruising setback for Mr Cameron, nine of the 20 members of his Business Advisory Group also declined to put pen to paper.They include Nigel Wilson, the boss of Britain's biggest pensions and investment firm Legal and General.An outspoken Eurosceptic, he has previously said Britain would be better off leaving the single market if it fails to negotiate meaningful reform. But he has also stressed the case for Brexit is 'unproven' and that it is up to the public – not company bosses – to decide Britain's future.Other business advisers to Mr Cameron who did not sign the letter included Robert Noel, the boss of Land Securities, Jeff Fairburn, of housebuilder Persimmon, Liv Garfield, of Severn Trent, and Ana Botin, the chairwoman of Santander.The remaining bosses who refused to tow the line were Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Chinese tech firm Alibaba Group, Steve Varley, of accountant EY, and Steve Wadey, of QinetiQ, the defence technology firm. 

Voting to leave the EU will 'neutralise' extremists who try to exploit immigration fears, Boris Johnson insists2016-6-19Voting for Brexit would 'neutralise' extremists who try to exploit people's fears over mass immigration, Boris Johnson has insisted.The former London mayor spoke out as supporters of cutting ties with Brussels condemned a controversial Ukip referendum poster.Nigel Farage unveiled the poster - which featured the headline 'Breaking Point' over an image of refugees walking into Europe through Slovenia - on Thursday just hours before Labour MP Jo Cox was shot dead and the referendum battle was suspended.Boris Johnson told a rally in London today that Brexit was the best way to 'neutralise' extremists spreading fear about immigration Justice Secretary Michael Gove today revealed he 'shuddered' when he saw it, while House of Commons Leader Chris Grayling said it was 'wrong'. And speaking at a rally in London today, Mr Johnson argued that leaving the EU would help silence those who 'play politics' with immigration. 'I'm not only pro-immigration, I'm pro-immigrants,' he said.'And I am in favour of an amnesty of illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years, unable to contribute to this economy, unable to pay taxes, unable to take proper part in society.'I'll tell you why. Because it is the humane thing to do. It is the economically rational thing to do.'And it means taking back control of a system that is at the moment completely out of control.'If we take back control of our immigration system with an Australian-style points based system, we'll be dealing fairly and justly with every part of the world and we will be neutralising people in this country and across Europe who wish to play politics with immigration and who are opposed to immigrants.'That is the way forward. To neutralise the extremists.'Mr Johnson, who was celebrating his birthday today, was address an audience of a few hundred people alongside Mr Gove and employment minister Priti Patel and Labour's Kate Hoey.Mr Gove said leaving the EU will not just be a 'vote of confidence' for Britain but will show solidarity with those in struggling economies such as Greece, Spain and Portugal who, he claimed, have suffered because of the EU.He said: 'The people who lead the European Union have never said sorry, never apologised, never admitted that they've got anything wrong.Labour MP Jo Cox, who was killed last week'Why? Because they believe that they can ride roughshod over expressions of popular opinion and concern.'He added: 'We'll be saying that they're running the countries of Europe into the ground.'Ms Hoey warned that the EU was 'no longer a social Europe' and was instead a 'Europe for the elite'.She said: 'As a Labour MP, I feel very strongly that (the EU) has been working more and more in the interests of the big banks, the big corporations.'It's in the interests of those people to stop the small business people, to stop them from being able to compete with them.'That is why working class people will vote leave.'Campaigning resumed today after being put on hold in the aftermath of the fatal attack on Mrs Cox, a strong supporter of Britain staying in the EU.The man charged with her murder, Thomas Mair, gave his name as 'death to traitors, freedom for Britain' when he appeared in court on Saturday.A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday found Remain had opened up a three-point lead on 45 per cent to 42 per cent - reversing the firm's findings from Thursday.Another showed the two sides are level while a third has voters saying they are more enthusiastic about leaving the EU than staying.Pollsters have suggested that the apparent surge for Remain could be down to undecided voters plumping for the status quo as the crucial ballot looms.But Mr Murrison complained that pro-EU figures may be exploiting the tragedy to bolster support for ties with Brussels.'Remain side spinning Jo Cox murder for partisan advantage in #EUReferendum shameful,' he wrote on Twitter.Within hours the MP had deleted the post and replaced it with one that said: 'Can both sides in this horrible #EUReferendum campaign & the press use the last few days to put case squarely, honestly and decently?'Pro-EU figures have stressed the need for unity and condemned the tone of the campaign in the wake of the killing.In a letter to the Observer today, Tony Blair, ex-deputy PM Nick Clegg and Conservative grandee Lord Heseltine say the vote is about 'what sort of country we are'.The message - which was highlighted on Twitter by David Cameron - said: 'There is something more fundamental at stake: the sort of country we are. A democracy where disagreements do not degenerate into incivility and where debate is not used to divide our communities.'We have a chance as a country to reject division, isolationism and blame. To choose co-operation. For the future of our children, that is a chance we must take.'Tory MP Andrew Murrison tweeted that Remain supporters were 'spinning' Jo Cox's killing, before deleting the post and urging both sides to put their cases 'squarely, honestly and decently'Mr Cameron has also posted about a strongly pro-EU article Mrs Cox wrote days before her death, stating.Alongside a link to the piece, Mr Cameron wrote: 'Jo Cox's strong voice in the campaign to remain in the EU will be badly missed.' Brexit campaigners Michael Gove and Chris Grayling today joined condemnation of a poster unveiled by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, depicting a queue of migrants on the Slovenian border and the message 'Breaking point'.Mr Gove said the image had made him shudder, but insisted it was right to raise other concerns about our inability to control our own borders. At a rally in London today, Boris Johnson insisted voting to cut ties with Brussels would 'neutralise' extremists who scaremonger about immigration.'I'm not only pro-immigration, I'm pro-immigrants,' the former London mayor said.'And I am in favour of an amnesty of illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years, unable to contribute to this economy, unable to pay taxes, unable to take proper part in society.'I'll tell you why.

Metropolitan elite are out of touch with ordinary, 'ghastly' Britons, says ex-BBC chief: Leaked email says Establishment 'ignores and despises' millions because they do not embrace liberal views2016-6-23Millions of people in Britain are 'ignored and despised' by the metropolitan elite because they do not embrace their liberal views, an ex-BBC editor has admitted.The metropolitan political class was said to be 'completely bewildered' about how to respond to the concerns of 'ghastly' ordinary people.There would be no end to the issues until the 'London bubble' had burst, said a report by David Cowling, former head of the BBC's political research unit.Fury at being overlooked for so long has led to vast numbers of Britons – many casting a ballot for the first time – to vote to quit the EU in a howl of frustration at the political elite. Pictured, ballot papers are countedSensitive subjects that worried households were barely acknowledged by the political class, his analysis claimed.Although he did not name specific issues, Mr Cowling would almost certainly have in mind mass immigration – routinely among the biggest fears of voters – and the way foreign arrivals have changed communities in the UK.For decades, politicians and the BBC have been accused of censoring debate, branding as 'racist' those who voiced concerns about the perceived erosion of our national identity or the pressure on jobs, housing, schools and healthcare. Fury at being overlooked for so long has led to vast numbers of Britons – many casting a ballot for the first time – to vote to quit the EU in a howl of frustration at the political elite.Mr Cowling, a former special adviser to a Labour Cabinet minister in the 1970s, made the withering assessment in an internal memo that was leaked on the internet. Mr Cowling, who is now a visiting senior research fellow at King's College London, wrote: 'It seems to me that the London bubble has to burst if there is to be any prospect of addressing the issues that have brought us to our current situation.'There are many millions of people in the UK who do not enthuse about diversity and do not embrace metropolitan values yet do not consider themselves lesser human beings for all that. Until their values and opinions are acknowledged and respected, rather than ignored and despised, our present discord will persist.'Because these discontents run very wide and very deep and the metropolitan political class, confronted by them, seems completely bewildered and at a loss about how to respond ('who are these ghastly people and where do they come from?' doesn't really hack it).'The 2016 EU referendum has witnessed the cashing in of some very bitter bankable grudges but I believe that, throughout this 2016 campaign, Europe has been the shadow not the substance.'Despite Mr Cowling's stinging evaluation, the BBC has been widely seen to have run an even-handed referendum campaign – setting aside what many see as a liberal bias.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, a leading Vote Leave supporter, said: 'This analysis is right and refreshing. The political parties and the BBC do not appreciate the legitimate concerns of a large proportion of the population.'The size of the leave vote will be a demonstration of the size of people's frustrations. A huge swathe of the population feel that their views are irrelevant to the metropolitan elite and the European elite.'The Establishment is out of touch with a huge proportion of our population.'The Corporation was said to be 'completely bewildered' about how to respond to the concerns of 'ghastly' ordinary people. Pictured the BBC headquarters in LondonMr Cowling, a specialist on political opinion polling, is a former editor of the BBC's political research unit, which runs a small team of researchers. He now works for the corporation as a freelancer on an 'ad hoc' basis.He has helped in the commissioning of polls by the BBC in all forms of elections, including at local, parliamentary and European level. Between 1977 and 1979 he was a special adviser to Environment Secretary Peter Shore in James Callaghan's Labour Government.His words echo those of the BBC's former director-general Mark Thompson who in 2011 admitted there had been 'some years' when the broadcaster was 'very reticent about talking about immigration'.Mr Thompson said such 'taboo' subjects were avoided by the BBC. He added: 'There was an anxiety about whether or not you might be playing into a political agenda if you did items on immigration.'A BBC spokesman said: 'This was an internal memo intended to help programme-makers create thought-provoking and broad-ranging impartial coverage.'It would wrong to read any more into this analysis than that.' 

Dave on rack over Turkey: PM fails three times to say he will veto country's entry to EU2016-6-19David Cameron refused three times to say he would veto Turkey's entry into the European Union last night as he faced public anger over his failure to curb immigration.Appearing on a special Question Time, the Prime Minister repeatedly ducked the question, claiming there was no prospect of the country becoming a member in the near future.He claimed the issue was 'the biggest red herring in this referendum debate' and that voting to leave for fear of Turkish entry would be a 'crazy thing to do'. But given three clear opportunities to say he would use his veto to stop it, he declined to do so.Vexed: David Cameron points his finger as he is taken to task on a BBC Question Time special last nightAppearing in his final TV debate before Thursday's vote, Mr Cameron received a mauling from the audience on his Government's approach to tackling EU immigration. He also risked accusations he was patronising the public after he said people have been finding the debate 'perhaps quite confusing'. He added he needed to do 'better' in getting the Government's message across.The debate also saw host David Dimbleby shock the audience after mistakenly saying the first question came from an audience member called 'Jo Cox'. He immediately apologised for the 'terrible' gaffe' and called the correct audience member, who asked Mr Cameron about the murdered MP.The issue of Turkey's accession has been a highly charged one, with the Leave camp claiming free movement rules could give millions of Turkish citizens the right to work in Britain. 'Terrible gaffe': The debate also saw host David Dimbleby, pictured with the Prime Minister, shock the audience after mistakenly saying the first question came from an audience member called 'Jo Cox'Last night Brexit campaigners said Mr Cameron sidestepped the question because he is actually a strong backer of Turkish membership. As recently as two years ago, he said: 'In terms of Turkish membership of the EU, I very much support that.' Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott said: 'You cannot trust Cameron on Turkey.' Three alleged terrorists have been charged in Belgium following a threat to attack fans during a Euro 2016 football game.The trio, accused of 'attempted terrorist murder', were among 12 suspects seized during a series of raids over the weekend. They were named by prosecutors as Samir C, Moustapha B and Jawad B.Belgian media had earlier reported that Islamists were planning to attack fans at an area of Brussels where the national team's games in the tournament in France are screened. Forty people were initially detained and 152 garages searched during the raids.Belgium is still reeling from the Islamic State suicide bombings at Brussels airport and on the city's metro on March 22 which killed 32 and wounded hundreds more. Officers moved on the town of Zaventem close to Brussels airport, with other raids taking place in the suburbs of Molenbeek, Schaarbeek and Forest.All are closely associated with the perpetrators of both the Paris and Brussels attacks.Molenbeek is notorious for being a hotbed of Islamic extremism where Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving member of the ten-man jihadist team that attacked Paris, killing 130 people, hid out for months until his dramatic arrest on March 18.During the debate in Milton Keynes, audience member Michael Tindale asked Mr Cameron: 'Will you veto the accession of Turkey into the EU?'The Prime Minister replied: 'I don't think it's going to happen for decades, so as far as I'm concerned the question doesn't arise.'I think this is the biggest red herring in this whole referendum debate. I can't find a single expert anywhere in the country or in Europe who thinks that Turkey's going to join the EU in the next three decades.'This issue doesn't arise and I feel strongly about this because people are getting through their letterbox leaflets from Leave saying basically Turkey's gong to join the EU – not true; there's going to be a European army with Britain in it – not true; and we give £350million a week to Brussels – not true. If we want to vote to leave ... let's not do it on the basis of three things that are completely untrue.'Asked by Mr Dimbleby if he would veto Turkey's entry, Mr Cameron replied 'It's not going to come up', prompting jeers from the audience.'If this was going to happen in the next couple of years I would not support it, but it's not,' he said. He added that voting to Leave and 'damage our economy' on the basis of Turkey joining would be 'a crazy thing to do'.When asked again by Mr Dimbleby why he will not say he will veto Turkish entry in the future, the Prime Minister again sidestepped the question. He said Britain was being 'positive' to Turkey because we want it to be a 'Western-leaning' country, but admitted it 'isn't going very well at the moment'.Last night Mr Elliott said Mr Cameron had refused to say he would veto Turkey joining 'because – in his own words – he is the 'strongest possible advocate' of Turkey joining. He has said before that he is 'angry' that it is taking too long for Turkey to join.'The EU has recently accelerated talks with Turkey with David Cameron's support and UK taxpayers are sending £1billion ... to help them join.'Voters who challenged Cameron on migration'You say that your policy that you've negotiated with Europe cannot be overruled – it can. So are you really a 21st-century Neville Chamberlain waving a piece of paper in the air, saying to the public this is what I have, I have this promise where a dictatorship in Europe can overrule it. Simple answer – yes or no?'Left: 'I think it's only logical – if we have absolutely no limitations on immigration from the EU, people are obviously going to emigrate over here. We've got a public sector [and] our NHS under tremendous strain. You're not doing anything to invest in them to make them stronger or better, [while] knowing full well that if we don't put a limit on this immigration – and the only way to do that is to leave the single market – then everything is just going to get flooded. You're not doing anything to counter-balance all the immigration coming in to these services.'Right: 'You say that your policy that you've negotiated with Europe cannot be overruled – it can.

Cameron's migration deception: PM knew FOUR years ago he'd never meet immigration target while inside the EU, reveals former closest aide 2016-6-21David Cameron was told four years ago his immigration target was 'impossible' while Britain is in the EU – but continued to make the promise.The claim is made today by the Prime Minister's ex-closest aide Steve Hilton, who attended the meetings with senior Whitehall officials in 2012.He reveals Mr Cameron was warned 'directly and explicitly' by civil servants that his 'tens of thousands' net migration goal was not deliverable given EU freedom of movement rules.Despite this, the Prime Minister has repeatedly restated his ambition to hit the target – even including it in his 2015 general election manifesto. At no stage has he succeeded in cutting net migration to below 100,000.Mr Cameron denied the claims today and insisted that when Mr Hilton left government in 2012 immigration was falling and was close to the target. David Cameron, pictured today with ITV's Lorraine, denied claims from his former close aide Steve Hilton that civil servants said getting immigration to the tens of thousands was impossible Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Hilton recalls the warning to Mr Cameron, saying: 'We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it.'His comments amount to a charge that the Prime Minister has concealed from voters the inevitable failure of his flagship policy since early 2012.Mr Cameron denied the charge today, telling ITV's Lorraine: 'It's simply not right. Actually when Steve Hilton left Downing Street in 2012, net immigration had actually fallen quite substantially and it got down to 154,000, so not far away from the ambition that I set.'But look there are good ways of controlling immigration and my welfare break, saying that people who come and work here, have to work here for four years before they get full access to our welfare system, that's a good way, but pulling out of the single market, wrecking our economy, that is a bad way.' During the referendum campaign, Mr Cameron has insisted it is still achievable, but he faced public anger over his failure to curb immigration on the BBC's Question Time on Sunday night.Mr Hilton describes Britain's immigration system as 'broken' and says the target is 'simply not possible' while in the EU.The policy guru, godfather to one of the Cameron children, also attacks Chancellor George Osborne and the 'political elite' – whom he accuses of 'playing with fire' by demonising the public's desire for control over our borders and destiny.The Prime Minister's ex-closest aide Steve Hilton, pictured, who attended the meetings with senior Whitehall officials in 2012, said Cameron was warned against the target by civil servantsMr Hilton writes that the immigration system is a 'social disaster because the decency and tolerance of the British people … are mocked when they see their local communities and public services overwhelmed by sudden and unplanned-for arrivals of people in large numbers'.He adds that these 'dramatic changes … don't affect the neighbourhoods inhabited by our insular ruling elite'. It is also a political disaster, he writes, because 'when politicians make promises they cannot keep this erodes … faith in the democratic process'.Mr Hilton says it is 'offensive' for Remain campaigners to argue Brexit supporters 'want a meaner, narrower Britain'.Yesterday, as the clock ticked towards the historic vote:Fears about illegal immigration via Calais, such as migrants trying to break into lorries pictured yesterday, have dominated the referendum campaign The failure to cut immigration has been the PM's weak spot in the campaign.The closest he came to his target was in 2012, when the figure for 12 months to September was 154,000.But net migration in the 12 months to June 2015 was estimated to be 336,000.Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, covering 12 months to December 2015, estimate net migration to be 333,000. Just over half of this came from EU countries.Despite this, Mr Cameron said on Sky TV earlier this month he did not 'accept' he would never meet his target, first set in 2010, adding: 'I think it remains the right ambition for Britain.' In February, he said he was 'convinced' it was still achievable.Mr Hilton concludes: 'Undeliverable promises, an ungovernable country, an untrusted political establishment – this is what the EU has helped do to our country … time to leave.' 'The PM was told years ago we'd NEVER meet his migration targets while in the EU': Bombshell from friend and close aide who spent years at Cameron's side  By Steve Hilton You may be surprised to read that I believe the Prime Minister has done everything in his power to control immigration. The problem is that as the leader of an EU member state, he doesn't have enough power to control immigration.That goes to the heart not just of the migration debate, but of this entire referendum campaign and the decision we need to make as a nation in two days' time.In all the years I worked as an adviser to David Cameron, he expressed a very clear point of view about immigration, one that I share. We believe that immigration has enriched this country's economy and society. As the son of immigrant parents, I feel this particularly strongly; I will forever be grateful to this country for the incredible opportunities it has given me.Steve Hilton working with the Prime Minister in the Cabinet room of Number 10 Downing Street, when he was employed as an aide to David Cameron And now, as an immigrant myself — to another country that prides itself on its open, inclusive character, the United States — I am doubly grateful for the fact that we live in a world where people can move freely and put down roots in places far from where they were born.On many occasions, in public and private, I heard David Cameron set out his belief that precisely to protect this proud British heritage of welcoming people to our shores, immigration had to be controlled.He spoke approvingly of the fact that in the Eighties, Margaret Thatcher's governments got the balance right on immigration, and that this contributed to the important and unequivocally positive fact that no party of the extreme Right ever managed to win significant support for a xenophobic anti-immigrant agenda.He deplored the fact that subsequent Labour governments lost control of immigration, and was determined to get a grip. In office, I saw at first hand how seriously he took this responsibility. He had announced a clear commitment — to reduce the overall level of immigration to the tens of thousands annually — and understood very well that the public would rightly hold him to account for such a clear promise.Immigration, alongside the threat of Islamic terrorism, was one of the policy areas that, in my observation, most occupied his time and focus. If anything, there were times when I wished he would focus more on other priorities; things that were perhaps closer to my heart.But as the elected Prime Minister, he rightly got to call the shots.Mr Hilton says the problem is that as the leader of an EU member state, Mr Cameron doesn't have enough power to control immigrationAt the time, one of the main ways we assessed the success of our most important policies was through 'stock take' meetings. These involved ministers and civil servants responsible for a particular policy coming to No 10 for a long session, chaired by the Prime Minister, during which we could really get stuck into the details of how a particular reform was going.I remember the meetings on immigration towards the end of my time in Downing Street. Everyone around the table, in some way or another, was working hard to try to deliver the government's commitment.We were presented with analysis of the numbers of people coming to Britain through various routes, the impact of policy changes we had already made, and projections stretching into the future.The news was not good. We were way off target; indeed, the numbers were going in the wrong direction. We explored various policy options — and I'm sure that process continued after I left the government in May 2012. But I recall very clearly one of the points that was made to us by the expert officials in the room.We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which, of course, insists on the free movement of people within it.Mr Hilton says he remembers fighting endless battles with the Home Secretary Theresa May simply to get her agreement to the introduction of an Entrepreneur VisaNow let me make one thing clear. The Remain campaign and its supporters say that leaving the EU will not on its own solve our immigration problems, and they are right about that. Leaving the EU is not a silver bullet. But, as we were advised in government, it is impossible for the 'tens of thousands' target to be met unless we leave — or negotiate an end to, or exception from, the free movement rules, which is an option Brussels has always refused to countenance.In my view, the target itself is set at the wrong level. I would actually like to see more entrepreneurs, engineers, computer scientists — as well as those in genuine need of refuge — welcomed to Britain. I think that would help boost our economy and strengthen, not weaken, our society.Others might take a different view: you could judge the Prime Minister's target to be about right. Or too high. That's what elections are for, to debate things like that.But the point is, whatever the policy, whatever people vote for, it's not unreasonable to expect that the Prime Minister of the day is able to deliver it. That is simply not possible in the current, unreformed — and in my view unreformable — EU.You don't need to sit in a 'stock take' meeting at No 10 Downing Street to see the obvious truth: our immigration system is completely broken, and as long as we're in the EU, our elected governments are powerless to fix it. Here are the ways in which this is a disaster.It's an economic disaster because it means we have to clamp down on immigration that could benefit our economy (skilled labour) in favour of immigration from the EU that often doesn't (unskilled labour).I remember fighting endless battles with the Home Secretary Theresa May simply to get her agreement to the introduction of an Entrepreneur Visa that would allow people from overseas with real potential to start their businesses here. It happened in the end, but only after massive internal opposition and watering down.More broadly, almost every day in government we heard complaints about incredible individuals, whom we ought to have welcomed with a red carpet, being harassed and treated like second-class citizens by our immigration authorities.Such people included Nobel Prize-winning scientists from Russia, some of our biggest investors from India, or even high-spending shoppers from China.Our broken immigration system is a social disaster because the decency and tolerance of the British people, virtues that our politicians so love to talk about when it suits them, are mocked when they see their local communities and public services overwhelmed by sudden and unplanned-for arrivals of people in large numbers — the kind of dramatic changes which, needless to say, don't affect the neighbourhoods inhabited by our insular ruling elite.Mr Hilton says that as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have said, when politicians make promises they can't keep, it undermines not just faith in individual politicians but everybody's faith in the democratic process itselfAnd, of course, all this is a political disaster because, as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have said, when politicians make promises they can't keep, it undermines not just faith in individual politicians but everybody's faith in the democratic process itself.In the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the Prime Minister re-affirmed his commitment to the immigration target he had been told was undeliverable. When I saw that, I assumed this was either because he was certain he could negotiate a solution within the EU, or was assuming we would leave.For the Government to continue to make the promise today, after no negotiated solution was achieved and while campaigning to stay, is, I think, what Gove and Johnson meant when they described this as corrosive of trust in politics.There's a broader argument here, too, because the EU debate isn't just about immigration, which is why it is so offensive for the Remain campaign to argue, as George Osborne put it, that those like me who want to leave the EU 'want a meaner, narrower Britain'.The fact is that with areas such as the economy, the environment, our legal system — which affect people's everyday lives in Britain — membership of the EU makes it impossible for the elected government to govern our country in the true sense of the word.It seems to me that here in Britain, and especially in this referendum campaign, our insular ruling elite is playing with fire.By dismissing — or worse, demonising — people's desire for control over the things that matter to them, and their perfectly reasonable expectation that the government they elect should have the power to deliver its promises, the rulers are the ones stoking the anger they decry.Undeliverable promises. An ungovernable country. An untrusted political establishment. This is what the EU has helped do to our country. We can't go on like this. It's time for change. It's time to leave.

Undecided? Read this essential guide giving 20 reasons why you should choose to leave2016-6-221. A QUESTION OF SOVEREIGNTYLeaving the EU would offer a chance to put the UK in charge of our own destiny and laws again — and restore our status as a sovereign nation.According to the Commons Library, up to 60 per cent of regulations originate from the EU and the 28-member Commission in Brussels — none of whom were elected. Britain’s Commissioner, Lord (Jonathan) Hill, is a former lobbyist and Tory researcher who has never stood for elected office in his life. Nor had his predecessor, Cathy Ashton, a Labour appointee and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament official. 2. STRIKING GLOBAL TRADE DEALSWe’d be free to negotiate our own trade deals — especially with the world’s emerging new economies.Since we import £89 billion of goods more annually from other EU countries than we sell to them, the EU stands to lose more than Britain if it seeks to impose tariffs post-Brexit. We are a crucial export market for Germany, the EU’s most powerful country, which would be the post-Brexit deal-maker.Since we import £89 billion of goods more annually from other EU countries than we sell to them, the EU stands to lose more than Britain if it seeks to impose tariffs post-Brexit. Pictured: Tilbury Docks, London3. JOB MARKET THAT WOULD STILL EXISTThere are an estimated 3.3 million British jobs ‘linked’ to our membership of the EU. By the same measure, there are more than five million jobs on the Continent that are linked to trade with Britain. This includes one million jobs in Germany, 494,000 in France, 309,000 in Italy and 421,000 in Spain.4. THE BILLIONS WE GIFT TO BRUSSELSWe pay far more into the EU budget than we get back — making a net contribution of around £8.5 billion last year (£23 million a day), which is more than we spend on the police service or border controls.The NHS costs £8.5 billion a month and the Health Service would get an extra £5 billion a year as a result of Brexit.Also, almost £1 billion of British cash goes to the EU for international aid.5. HOW TO CONTROL OUR BORDERSCurrently there’s no upper limit on migration and no proper control of our borders. More than three million EU migrants live in the UK — double the number in 2004 when the EU expanded to include Eastern European countries, who have sent more than a million people here (despite the last Labour Government saying it would be only 13,000 a year.)Net migration from EU countries to the UK, according to official figures, is 184,000 a year — enough to fill a city the size of Oxford. David Cameron has never hit his target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands — and most agree he never will if we remain inside the EU.Using a new points-system, every applicant to live here would be treated on their merit rather than on their nationality6. WHAT KIND OF MIGRATION SYSTEM?Under EU law, we must let in any EU citizen regardless of their qualifications. The result? Businesses can’t get work permits for highly skilled or educated people from the Commonwealth, U.S., Australia and elsewhere outside the EU.Using a new points-system, every applicant to live here would be treated on their merit rather than on their nationality. Equally, we’d be able to accept more genuine refugees.7. MEDDLING BY FOREIGN JUDGESParliament is powerless, under EU treaties, to defend itself against the rulings of the European Court of Justice — which has interfered in everything from the price of beer to the right to deport terror suspects.The UK has lost three-quarters of the cases it’s challenged since 1973. This makes a mockery of the idea that the UK’s Supreme Court is supreme.8. FOREIGN RAPISTS AND KILLERSThanks to Brussels diktats, some of the EU’s most evil killers, rapists and drug-dealers have been allowed to remain here — because their right to free movement has been put ahead of keeping the British public safe.A report by the Labour-led Commons Home Affairs Committee said the number of foreign criminals who had not been deported could fill a ‘small town’. British jails hold almost 10,000 foreign prisoners — including 1,000 Poles.A report by the Labour-led Commons Home Affairs Committee said the number of foreign criminals not been deported could fill a ‘small town’. British jails hold almost 10,000 foreign prisoners - including 1,000 Poles9. KEEPING OUT UNDESIRABLESUK law stops anyone from outside the EU entering Britain if their presence is deemed ‘not conducive to the public good’, but Brussels says EU citizens can only be turned away if there is a ‘serious, credible and present threat’.Thus the list of criminals able to come here include a Latvian who murdered his wife before moving to the UK, where he killed a 14-year-old girl. Over the past decade, UK officials have only been able to turn away 11,000 EU nationals.10. PROTECTING US FROM TERRORISMThe EU’s Frontex border security agency has warned that jihadists are exploiting the Union’s open borders and the migrant crisis to sneak into the continent and plot atrocities. Two of the attackers responsible for last year’s outrages in Paris used exactly this approach.The British head of Europol also said that as many as 5,000 Islamic State-trained jihadists are moving freely in Europe. And Sir Richard Dearlove, ex-head of MI6, said we could be safer outside of the EU as it would be easier to deport fanatics. Leaving the EU would still allow us to work with U.S. intelligence agencies — as the so-called gold standard ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence-sharing partnership consists of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.S. and the UK.Sir Richard Dearlove (pictured in 2011), ex-head of MI6, said we could be safer outside of the EU as it would be easier to deport fanatics11. WILL TURKEY BE ALLOWED TO JOIN?David Cameron has repeatedly refused to drop his government’s support for Turkey — which has 77 million citizens — joining the EU.Yet he’s said that at the current rate it won’t join until the year 3000 — despite the European Commission announcing last week that Turkey’s membership application was being ‘accelerated’.Before the referendum campaign, the PM said his wish was to ‘pave the road from Ankara [Turkey’s capital]’ to Brussels. Turkish citizens are already being given visa-free access to mainland Europe after a deal that saw the Turks getting £4.6 billion in aid.Campaign group Migration Watch has warned an extra 100,000 Turks would flock to Britain every year if the predominantly Muslim country joined the EU.Campaign group Migration Watch has warned an extra 100,000 Turks would flock to Britain every year if the predominantly Muslim country joined the EU12. THE CORRUPTION OF EU OFFICIALDOMLast year — for the 21st year running! — the EU Court of Auditors admitted that Brussels expenditure was compromised by irregularities, with ‘a persistently high level of payment errors, which means too much money is still not spent in accordance with the EU’s financial rules’.13. AND THE ROTTEN EUROPEAN ECONOMYBy the end of last year, the UK economy was 6.8 per cent larger than it was at the start of 2008, whereas the EU economy was only 1.9 per cent bigger (France’s grew by 2.9 per cent and Italy’s is 8.8 per cent smaller than in 2008)).Also, unemployment in the UK is five per cent — less than half the 10.2 per cent jobless rate in the eurozone. (In Greece, it is 24 per cent — with youth unemployment at a desperate 51 per cent — and 20 per cent in Spain).Unemployment in the UK is five per cent — less than half the 10.2 per cent jobless rate in the eurozone. In Greece, it is 24 per cent — with youth unemployment at a desperate 51 per cent (file picture)14. BUSINESS TIED UP IN RED TAPETreasury research has shown that the EU’s ‘single market’ rules could impose costs of seven per cent of GDP on the UK economy. At £125 billion a year, that’s the equivalent of £4,639 per household. Only 6 per cent of British companies export to the EU — but all must comply with EU ‘single market’ legislation.Small businesses — the lifeblood of our economy — suffer most, whereas big firms can lobby Brussels.15. PROTECTING PUBLIC SERVICESFreedom of movement rules mean we have no idea many foreigners settle here — which means it’s impossible to plan the necessary health, education, transport and housing requirements for them. This has led to intense pressures for anyone trying to get a school place for their child or a GP appointment.Rents are rising and first-time buyers struggle to get on the housing ladder as prices soar and supply diminishes.With five more nations — Turkey, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia — hoping to join the EU, this will only get worse.Patients lined up at 6.30am outside The Sunbury Health Centre, Surrey, for a same-day GP appointment. The picture paints a bleak picture of the  oversubscribed health service put under strain by freedom of movement16. CONTROLLING ASYLUM SEEKERSAccording to its own statistics, 1.3 million people claimed asylum in the EU last year. Some 363,000 came from Syria. Applicants who get EU citizenship are free to move to the UK.17. THE FARMING BUDGET SCANDALDespite contributing 12.5 per cent of the overall EU budget, the UK sees just 7 per cent of the Common Agricultural Policy budget spent here. By contrast, France gets 16.4 per cent, Spain 11.6 per cent, Germany 11.3 per cent, Italy 10.1 per cent and Poland 8.8 per cent.The EU’s farm subsidy system meant that prior to 2003, the so-called Single Farm Payment was linked to how much farmers produced — leading to massive over-production and waste.Now, farmers don’t have to produce a set amount — they are paid automatically for keeping land in ‘agricultural condition’. As a result, it’s been reported wealthy landowners absurdly get Brussels payments for having pony paddocks.Despite contributing 12.5 per cent of the overall EU budget, the UK sees just 7 per cent of the Common Agricultural Policy budget spent here. Pictured: A farm on the South Downs, East Sussex18. THE BARMIEST GREEN LAWSFollowing the EU’s ban on incandescent light-bulbs, many people suffered epilepsy from the flickering, supposedly eco-friendly fluorescent bulbs. Equally controversially, vacuum cleaners sold in the EU have been limited to an output of 1,600 watts. This directive is expected to be extended to kettles, toasters, hair-dryers and other domestic appliances.19. THE TRUTH ABOUT VAT RATESUnder EU rules, once a product is liable for VAT, any EU member government is not allowed to abolish that tax without Brussels’ approval. Thus, the lowest VAT Westminster can impose is 5 per cent — which imposes hardship on some British families with VAT charged at 5 per cent on energy bills. (Our Government even had to seek permission to scrap the levy charged on tampons.) Brussels pockets around 0.3 per cent of VAT paid.20. LOSING CONTROL OF OUR SEASEU membership has devastated our fishing industry — halving the number of fisherman to fewer than 12,000 since 1975. Under international law, each nation enjoys an ‘Exclusive Economic Zone’ extending 200 miles from its coast. However, the Common Fisheries Policy pools the zones of member states into a single zone.The first 12 miles is restricted to a nation’s own fishermen, but the area from 12 miles to 200 miles is open to the fleets of any EU member state.Spanish vessels last year got a quota of 15,546 tonnes of hake for a large area of the Atlantic off Scotland while UK vessels were allowed just 7,131 tonnes. Leaving the EU would allow us to fish our own waters — and breathe new life into harbour towns.EU membership has devastated our fishing industry — halving the number of fisherman to fewer than 12,000 since 1975 (file picture) 

Sir Cover-up faces bias quiz by MPs over accusations he used the Government machine to support the Remain campaign2016-6-23Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, has been accused of allowing the civil service to become an 'engine for pro-EU propaganda'Britain's top civil servant is to be hauled before MPs to explain his use of the Government machine in support of the 'Remain' campaign.Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, has come under fire for instructing officials not to help anti-EU ministers during the referendum - and for allowing government websites to be plastered with Remain material.Last month Iain Duncan Smith accused him of allowing the civil service to become an 'engine for pro-EU propaganda'.Now it has emerged that the Commons public administration committee will demand Sir Jeremy – known as Sir Cover-Up for his attitude to the freedom of information – to appear before it. Bernard Jenkin, Tory Leave campaigner and chairman of the committee, said: 'We are going to hold a post-referendum inquiry and without doubt Sir Jeremy Heywood will be a key witness.'There will be questions about purdah, the quality of advice to civil servants, the whole conduct of government during the run-up to the referendum, as well as questions about improvements that can be made to electoral machinery and the Electoral Commission.'Brexit campaigners are angry at advice written by Sir Jeremy which banned civil servants from giving information pertaining to the EU campaign to those ministers campaigning for Leave.They were also concerned at the mountain of scaremongering propaganda put out by government departments up to the end of May, and the way government websites have been covered in pro-Remain information. The Leave camp accuse Sir Jeremy of blocking the release of sensitive information about the impact of the EU on public services.Tory backbenchers also claim he has ordered civil servants to refuse to answer parliamentary questions that might jeopardise David Cameron's bid to keep Britain in the EU.There will also be questions about the Cabinet Office's decision to extend voter registration for 48 hours after the Electoral Commission website went down for 90 minutes.Last month Iain Duncan Smith accused Sir Jeremy of allowing the civil service to become an 'engine for pro-EU propaganda'Lord Tebbit, the pro-Brexit former Tory chairman, said: 'I think the civil service has been misused.' But he said he blamed the Prime Minister rather than Sir Jeremy, because the Cabinet Secretary had to bow to his orders.One Tory backbencher said: 'The Cabinet Secretary only does what the Prime Minister wants him to do.'Examples of taxpayer-funded 'propaganda' included a message in huge letters displayed on the Treasury website saying: 'UK economy would fall into RECESSION if Britain leaves the EU'.

Katie Price tells debate she is 'confused' over referendum and admits she's never even voted - even though she stood for Parliament when she was 232016-6-22Katie Price has admitted she has never voted before - despite having stood for parliament.The mother-of-five made the admission as she revealed she was still 'confused' over which way to vote in tomorrow's referendum during a debate on Channel 4.However, this is far from the former model's first foray into the political arena, having stood as an independent promising free holidays on the NHS back in 2001.Katie Price told audience members at the Channel 4 debate on the EU referendum that she was still confused about which way to vote on Thursday, and that it would be the first time she votedHowever, this is not her first foray into politics. In 2001 - then aged just 23 - she launched a bid to become an MP in the Stretford and Urmston constituency of Greater ManchesterMs Price - who was then known as Jordan - stood in the Stretford and Urmston constituency of Greater Manchester, telling voters: 'I know it will take a big swing to win the seat but there's no bigger swinger than me.'Backed by the Daily Star, she ran under the slogan 'Vote Jordan for a bigger and betta future'.It wasn't a success: she polled just over 700 votes in the end - and it appears she didn't even cast a ballot for herself.Speaking during the EU debate this evening, Ms Price revealed she would vote for the first time tomorrow, but still couldn't decide whether to back the Leave or Remain campaigns.'Well believe it or not, I came here confused, and I am more confused,' she said. 'I've never voted before, I feel I am pressured I have to vote this time,'Lot's of my friends are in, some are out, I'm asking them lots of questions. Backed by the Daily Star, she ran under the slogan 'Vote Jordan for a bigger and betta future'It wasn't a success: she polled just over 700 votes in the end - and after tonight's revelation, it appears she didn't even cast a ballot for herself. Pictured: Ms Price makes her speech after the result in June 2001'My son's got disabilities, so in my case, I'm thinking, what would be the best for his future, for the NHS, if he goes on holiday. 'Do I think of myself as a family, or the country? I am just confused. This has made it confusing.' The Channel 4 debate, which had an audience of 150, equal parts Leave, Remain and undecided, ended with 52 per cent of the audience backing staying in the European Union.   

Michael Gove makes grovelling apology for comparing pro-EU experts to Nazi propagandists after Cameron accuses him of having ‘lost it’ during referendum battle2016-6-22Michael Gove has made a grovelling apology after comparing pro-EU experts to Nazi propagandists.The Justice Secretary admitted he had been 'clumsy and inappropriate' to make the comments as he dismissed dire forecasts for the consequences of Brexit.The climbdown came after David Cameron branded the remarks a 'massive mistake' and suggested that Mr Gove had 'lost it'.Recalling the Nazis' treatment of Jewish scientist Einstein during the 1930s, Mr Gove had told LBC: 'I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and to ask if these arguments are good.Michael Gove (pictured) compared economic experts warning about the fall-out of Brexit to the Nazis who orchestrated a smear campaign against Albert Einstein in the 1930s'We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his theories were denounced, and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was because he was Jewish.'They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said: 'Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.'''Mr Gove added: 'The truth is that if you look at the quality of the analysis, if you look at the facts on the ground, you can come to an appropriate conclusion.'And the appropriate conclusion, I think, all of us can come to is that with growth rates so low in Europe, with so many unemployed and with the nature of the single currency so damaging, freeing ourselves from that project can only strengthen our economy.'He made his comments after being challenged over why he is not heeding the advice of many economists who have warned that Brexit could have dire consequences and tip the economy into recession.The International Monetary Fund, ten Nobel-prize winning economists and the Bank of England have all warned that leaving the EU could damage the economy.And in a letter in The Times today, the bosses of 1,285 firms that employ 1.75million people write: 'Britain leaving the EU would mean uncertainty for our firms, less trade with Europe and fewer jobs. In a statement today Mr Gove said: 'Yesterday I was asked a question by Iain Dale about the predictions of doom for the economy. 'I answered as I often do with a historical analogy. It was clumsy and inappropriate. 'Obviously I did not mean to imply anything about the motives of those who have spoken out in favour of staying in the EU. 'Throughout the campaign I’ve avoided making personal attacks, I'm sorry for speaking so clumsily, and apologise for giving offence. 'I think Britain will be more prosperous if we end our connection to the euro project and I should have answered this question directly.' In a dramatic escalation of Tory infighting earlier, Mr Cameron told Sky News: 'To hear the Leave campaign today sort of comparing independent experts and economists to Nazi sympathisers - I think they have rather lost it.'These people are independent - economists who have won Nobel prizes, business leaders responsible for creating thousands of jobs, institutions that were set up after the war to try to provide independent advice. It is right to listen.'In a joint statement, three respected economic think-tanks have said 'almost all those who have looked seriously' at the consequences of Brexit agreed it would be highly likely to harm the living standards of UK households.James Bond star Daniel Craig (pictured left) revealed his support for Britain staying in the EU after posing in a T-shirt with the slogan: 'No man is an island. No country by itself. Vote Remain on 23rd June'. It came hours after David and Victoria Beckham (pictured right) declared their support for Britain staying in the EUJames Bond star Daniel Craig is the latest celebrity to declare his support for Britain staying in the EU. He was pictured last night wearing a white T-shirt with the slogan: 'No man is an island. No country by itself. Vote Remain on 23rd June.' The picture of the retiring James Bond in the pro-EU T-shirt was first published by Turner Prize-winning artist Wolfgang Tillmans, who told his Instagram followers that Craig had sent him the picture. Minutes after the picture appeared online David Cameron tweeted it along with the words: 'It's great to see Daniel Craig is planning to Vote Remain on Thursday.' It delivers another boost to the Remain campaign after the endorsements of David and Victoria Beckham urged voters to support staying in the EU 'for our children'.The England footballing hero and his fashion designer wife said Britain should be facing the challenges of the world together with its allies. He was joined by his former England colleague Rio Ferdinand, who compared EU membership to playing the success they achieved at Manchester United.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) and Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) said: 'In our lifetimes we have never seen such a degree of unanimity among economists on a major policy issue.' Mr Gove, who co-chairs the Vote Leave campaign, said experts cannot always be trusted and pointed to the German scientists used to denounce Einstein to back up his point.He also hinted that he will quit government if voters do not back Brexit in the EU referendum this week, saying he would 'reflect' on the result before deciding his future. His comments came as the bosses of more than half of Britain's biggest businesses urged voters to avoid causing economic chaos by voting to stay in the EU in tomorrow's historic referendum. In the largest business endorsement of the bitter campaign so far, 1,285 bosses representing 51 of the FTSE 100 firms that a vote to leave the EU would cost jobs, trigger uncertainty and less trade for Britain.  'Britain remaining in the EU would mean the opposite – more certainty, more trade and more jobs,' they wrote.'EU membership is good for business and good for British jobs. That's why, on June 23rd, we back Britain remaining in the EU.' They claim small businesses and their staff are 'particularly vulnerable' from a Brexit vote.  Yesterday Mr Gove again attacked David Cameron over his failure to curb immigration.The Justice Secretary, a close friend of the Prime Minister, argued that cutting ties with Brussels was the only way of regaining control over our borders.But he also rejected criticism that the Tories manifesto for the general election had been a 'lie' amid claims David Cameron was told by civil servants four years ago that a key immigration pledge could not be met within the bloc.Asked about his future during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Gove said: 'I will do exactly as the Prime Minister asks me.'I want people to concentrate not on my job but on their jobs. Of course, depending on what the result is on Friday, I will reflect and I will decide what is the best course for me.' Mr Gove's latest comments came as six leading figures from the Remain and Vote Leave campaigns went head-to-head in a bruising, two-hour debate at Wembley Arena last night. In the final major showdown of the bitter campaign - coming less than 36 hours before polls open in the historic referendum, leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson urged voters to make the EU referendum Britain's 'Independence Day'. He was involved in brutal clashes with Sadiq Khan and fellow Tory Ruth Davidson in the crunch TV debate.With less than 36 hours left until the polls open, Mr Johnson laid into the Remain side for 'talking the country down' by issuing a slew of dire Project Fear warnings about the consequences of cutting ties with Brussels. But newly-installed London Mayor Mr Khan hit back by accusing him of telling 'lie after lie' and running 'Project Hate', while Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson lashed out at him for trying to turn the programme into 'the Boris show'.The exchanges came as the sides clashed in a BBC special at Wembley Arena likely to have been watched by millions.Boris Johnson (pictured) said Dyson founder James Dyson was one of many businessmen in favour of Brexit. Sadiq Khan (right) accused the Leave campaign of telling 'lie after lie' Mr Johnson was joined by Tory Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom and Labour's Gisela Stuart for the programme in front of a 6,000 strong live audience.Alongside Mr Khan were Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson and TUC Secretary General Frances O'Grady.Taking to the stage in London tonight, Mr Khan said the country would face the 'most important decision for a generation' on Thursday.A Remain vote would mean people are 'both better off and safer'.Audience member Maxine Fothergill said she was a small business owner employing 10 staff and told the panellists that her firm was one of many in the UK that were 'stifled' by EU regulation. Ms Davidson said she knew the EU was 'a bit frustrating but what it means is you cannot be undercut'.She insisted that tariffs and taxes would be increased if we were outside the EU.But Mr Johnson laughed off the idea of tariffs, arguing that Germany sold a fifth of its car output in the UK. 'I must say that I think that it was extraordinary to hear that we would have tariffs imposed on us because everybody knows that this country receives about a fifth of Germany's entire car manufacturing output - 820,000 vehicles a year,' he said.'Do you seriously suppose that they are going to be so insane as to allow tariffs to be imposed between Britain and Germany? In some of the most heated scenes of the evening, Ms Davidson accused Mr Johnson of not caring about workers, saying he would not 'guarantee jobs'.But Mr Johnson said: 'They are back to Project Fear within moments. They have nothing positive to say.' 

You're not getting anything else! Cameron got the 'maximum' from his renegotiation and the EU has no more to offer after Brexit vote, Commission boss warns 2016-6-22British voters were today warned there is no chance of a second renegotiation with the EU if they back Brexit tomorrow.Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU Commission President, said 'out is out' and ruled out re-opening talks in a bid to reverse a vote to quit the EU.In remarks sure to be seized upon by the Vote Leave campaign, Mr Juncker said David Cameron got the 'maximum' reform possible in his renegotiation that was concluded in February.The deal has been derided as empty and useless by Brexit campaigners and the Prime Minister has been forced to admit more reform is still needed.EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker today claimed David Cameron had already extracted the 'maximum' from the EU Britain would not get any other reforms by voting for Brexit Mr Juncker said today: 'The British policy makers and British voters have to know that there will not be any kind of renegotiation.'Out is out.' He added: 'We have concluded a deal with the prime minister. He got the maximum he could receive and we gave the maximum we could give.'So there will be no renegotiation, not on the agreement we found in February, nor as far as any kind of treaty negotiations are concerned.'Vote Leave champion Michael Gove said: 'The Remain Campaign has been claiming in recent days that if you vote to stay in the EU then there could be further reform. The President of the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, has made very clear today that will not happen.'If you vote to stay there is no prospect of getting any reform from the EU ever again. We will never get back control of the £350 million we give to the EU every week. The Prime Minister tried to get reforms earlier this year but the EU did not listen. The EU cannot and will not give the British people the change that they want.'There is a very clear choice in this referendum. Either you vote to keep on giving the EU more power and more of our money every year or join me in voting leave to take back control.' Elsewhere today, French President Francois Hollande said a vote to leave would carry a 'very serious' risk of ending British access to the EU's prized single market. He said: 'There's a very serious risk for the United Kingdom not to be able to access the common market and ... the European economic area anymore.'France would 'draw all the conclusions' of such a vote, he warned. 'This would be irreversible.'Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg fears a British vote to leave the EU would make Europe 'weaker, more fragmented and nationalistic.'In comments to Norwegian broadcaster NRK, the leader of the oil-rich Scandinavian country that has twice voted in referendums to stay out of the EU said a weaker Europe would mean the economic situation will be more difficult when reforms and competitiveness are needed.She said: 'But it will also mean a more political and fragmented Europe, a weaker Europe and a weaker world.'Ms Solberg said that in a world where 'we are increasingly dependent on each other and solve issues together, it's dangerous to demolish joint institutions,' adding that she is 'deeply worried' should Britain opt out of the EU.French president Francois Hollande said a Brexit vote would risk Britain getting locked out of the single market which offers tariff free trading across the EU On Monday, Donald Tusk issued a direct appeal to Britain not to vote for Brexit, urging voters to 'stay with us'.The European Council president made the last ditch plea with just three days until the United Kingdom votes on whether to Leave or Remain a member of the European Union.Brussels had largely stayed out of the referendum battle until polls suggested Britain could vote for Brexit on Thursday - prompting Mr Tusk to issue a dire warning about the collapse of 'western political civilisation'.Mr Tusk, who is responsible for running the council meetings attended by heads of state and government, today struck a more conciliatory tone.He said: 'I would like to appeal to the British citizens, on behalf, I know that for a fact, of almost all Europeans and European leaders: Stay with us.'Without you, not only Europe, but the whole Western community will become weaker. Together, we will be able to cope with increasingly difficult challenges of the future.'David Cameron was back on the stump for the final day of campaigning today as he scrambled to convince voters not to back a Brexit tomorrow He added: 'In no way are we downplaying the economic costs that would accompany Brexit ... I have no doubt, however, that we are already prepared for the day after the referendum.'Mr Tusk acknowledged the EU would need to be reformed regardless of the result on Thursday because of growing Euroscepticism across the continent.He said: 'We would be foolish if we ignored such a warning signal as the UK referendum.'There are more signals of dissatisfaction with the Union coming from all of Europe, not only from the UK.'  

The Tories will not fight the by-election to fill Jo Cox's seat as a 'mark of respect' to the murdered MP's 'extraordinary public service'2016-6-17Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said Labour should be given a free run in the by-election to replace Jo Cox as a tribute to her 'extraordinary public service' The Conservative Party will not contest the by-election to fill murdered MP Jo Cox's seat in Parliament.Following a call by ex-party chairman Grant Shapps to leave Labour a free run as a tribute to Mrs Cox's 'extraordinary public service', the Tories announced they would not fight Batley and Spen.The move, described as a 'mark of respect', is highly unusual but comes after almost 24 hours of fulsome tributes to the mother of two from across the political divide. A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'Following the tragic killing of Labour MP Jo Cox, the Conservative Party has decided not to contest the forthcoming by-election as a mark of respect to a much-loved and respected politician.' Mr Shapps earlier said: 'My thoughts and prayers with the family of Jo Cox MP, who was just doing her job serving the community she represented for too short a time.'I hope that in the sad by-election to follow, Jo Cox's constituency is left uncontested as a tribute to Jo's extraordinary public service.'The Liberal Democrats announced this afternoon they would follow suit. Party president Sal Brinton said: '(Lib Dem leader) Tim Farron, myself and the whole Liberal Democrat Party pass our sincere condolences to Brendan, their family and the wider Labour movement. Hate and fear will never win.'An outstanding champion for the vulnerable and the dispossessed, who represented her community brilliantly, was taken from us all.' Mrs Cox was first elected to the Commons in the 2015 general election, beating the Conservatives into second place with a majority 6,057 votes.Labour would be highly likely to successfully defend the majority in any event. Uncontested elections to the House of Commons are rare - generally only happening in the seat held by the Commons Speaker.Political parties could not forced to withdraw but other parties could unilaterally make the same decision as the Tories not to fight the seat.A writ to trigger the by-election will be moved by Labour chief whip Rosie Winterton at some point in the days or weeks after the House of Commons resumes following the EU referendum.Mr Shapps made his call for an uncontested by-election on Twitter after paying a warm tribute to Mrs Cox There are no strict rules on when the process must be started but once initiated, the campaign will run for around four weeks.The last by-election to the Commons was completed yesterday as Labour's Rosena Allin-Khan defended the Tooting constituency vacated by Sadiq Khan following his win in the race to be London Mayor.After her count was declared overnight, the A&E doctor said: 'My thoughts and prayers are with Jo's husband and her children. She was a proud and passionate campaigner who will be desperately missed.'Jo's death reminds us that our democracy is precious but fragile. We must never forget to cherish it.'Thousands of people voted today and we are all here in recognition of our democratic values.' 

The final countdown! All to play for as 11% of voters say they have yet to decide which way they will vote in today's historic EU referendum 2016-6-22The battle for Britain's future was on a knife edge last night with the final EU referendum polls making the contest too close to call.An exclusive survey for the Daily Mail and ITV News, gave the Remain camp a lead of six points, by 48 per cent to 42 per cent – but 11 per cent of electors said they were still undecided.Crucially, the Leave campaign's key message that now is the time for Britain to 'take control' of its own destiny has had the biggest cut-through with voters. Scroll down for videos Showdown: David Cameron and Boris Johnson criss-crossed the country as they campaigned yesterdaySome 44 per cent said it made them more likely to vote to quit the Brussels club – outstripping the claim by Project Fear that leaving is a leap in the dark.In a slew of other polls, Leave either led or the contest was neck and neck. The ComRes poll for the Mail reveals Britain is a divided country with over 45s and those in the North breaking heavily for Leave.All age groups below 45 appear in favour of staying with 64 per cent of those aged 25 to 34 wanting to stay and 27 per cent opting to go. Among the 55 to 65 age group, however, just 31 per cent want to Remain and 55 per cent want to Leave.In the South 38 per cent want to Leave while 51 per cent want to stay. But in the North, it is 41 per cent Remain and 50 per cent Leave. The Midlands is almost exactly balanced with 45 per cent support for Remain and 44 per cent for Leave.Overall, after 'don't knows' are counted, Remain would lead 54 per cent to 46 per cent. The poll of 1,032 adults was conducted over the weekend, during part of which the campaign was halted after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox.Some 17 per cent say that they may still change their mind.In its final survey, Opinium said after talking to 3,000 people the referendum was a 'statistical dead heat' with Leave on 45 per cent and Remain on 44 per cent - meaning after taking margin of error into account it was impossible to pick a winner Opinium's surveys during June have showed a small overall drift toward Leave as undecided voters made up their minds but the pollster said the race was still too close to call The reputation of key politicians has been hit. The number of voters citing David Cameron as important in their decision has fallen from 34 per cent in May to 26 per cent now.Only a third of Britons say Mr Cameron would be the best person to negotiate Britain's withdrawal from the EU as Prime Minister in the event of Brexit, though this is higher than anyone else.In a blow for Chancellor George Osborne, his warning that house prices will be lower in the event of Brexit made people more likely to vote Leave than Remain – by 17 per cent to 20 per cent.Last night a flurry of eve-of-referendum polls suggested the result is still too close to call, with TNS giving the Brexit camp a 43 per cent to 41 per cent advantage.A YouGov poll for The Times gave Remain a lead of 51 to 49. FTI Consulting gave Remain the edge by 51.4 per cent to 48.6 per cent once 'don't knows' are taken out. Boris Johnson gives a thumbs up as he leaves Selby, North Yorkshire, on a hectic day of campaigningDavid Cameron spoke alongside Lib Dem leader Tim Farron at a Remain rally in Birmingham this eveningOpinium Research recorded a tiny lead for Brexit in its final survey of 3,000 voters this week as it found 45 per cent backed Leave and 44 per cent backed Remain.But after taking into account the margin of error in the study, the firm declared it impossible to predict a winner.A week ago, Opinium had the referendum tied at 44 per cent each while at the start of June the pollster had Remain ahead 43-41.The poll fits with the mixed found by all of the polling firms in the last week of the race, with some results showing small leads for either side while other showed a tie.By contrast, betting markets have continued to show Remain as the strong favourite as the race enters its final hours. Adam Drummond, of Opinium Research said: 'This really is ''too close to call'' territory with undecided voters holding the balance of the vote in their hands.'Although referendum campaigns normally see a move back to the status quo as we get closer to polling day, this hasn't yet shown up in our polls and the Remain camp will have to hope that it happens in the polling booth itself if Britain is to stay in the European Union.' In its latest poll, Opinium interviewed 3,011 voters between Monday and Wednesday.David Cameron was greeted by school children as his whistlestop tour took him to Bloxham near Banbury yesterday in his final push for votes before the referendumBoris Johnson was mobbed as he took the Vote Leave campaign's final push to Selby in North Yorkshire The final

Labour's Harriet Harman for a rally in Bristol this morning.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has visited the famous Billingsgate Fish market as he traversed the country in a Vote Leave helicopter.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed activists in central London, while planes trailing Remain banners staged a flypast at the Houses of Parliament.During the rally in Bristol, Mr Cameron urged voters to

case could be summed up in the single word: 'Together'. The big beasts of the EU referendum battle were yesterday engaged in a final frantic round of campaigning on the eve of the crucial poll.David Cameron joined forces with former PM Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet Harman for a rally in Bristol before travelling to Oxfordshire, Banbury and on to Birmingham.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson kicked

at the Houses of Parliament this afternoon2pm: David Cameron and Harriet Harman met farmer David Christensen on Kington Hill Farm in Abingdon, Oxfordshire as he continued his campaign this afternoon David Cameron has blamed mass immigration on our 'unnatural' economy as he insisted numbers will be curbed if we stay in the EU.As the referendum campaign entered its final frantic hours, the Prime Minister said freedom of movement rules will be re-examined if we stay in the bloc.He defended his target of bringing net migration down from around 330,000 a year to below 100,000 as 'realistic', and also denied that being in the Brussels club was like being 'shackled to a corpse'.The claims came as both sides in the bitter campaign stepped up their efforts on the eve of the crucial ballot.In a bad-tempered interview in BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said immigration had been stubbornly running at around three times his target over recent years because it was 'not a normal period'.'As recently as 2008, if you look at the situation of British people and European nationals leaving Britain to go to Europe and European nationals coming to Britain, there was actually net negative migration in terms of Europe,' he said.'If we want a bigger economy and more jobs, we are better if we do it together,' the PM said.'If we want to fight climate change, we are better if we do it together. If we want to win against the terrorists and keep our country safe, we are better if we do it together.' Sir John took a swipe at Mr Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove as 'gravediggers of our prosperity', suggesting he had 'expected better' from them.Quitting the EU would not stem immigration and risked creating a broken Britain, he insisted.Leaving would be a 'disproportionate' response to migration concerns and the country would live to regret it for a 'long time to come'. 1pm: Jeremy Corbyn addressed activists in central London after speaking at the Unison conference in Brighton this morningThe former London Mayor took to the skies in a helicopter to continue the push for BrexitMr Johnson has appealed for voters to make the EU referendum Britain's 'Independence Day'He said: 'If our nation does vote to leave, we must respect their decision, but if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the grave-diggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer.''They will have to account for what they have said and done but that will be of little consolation for we will be out, out for good, diminished as an influence on the world. 'A truly Great Britain shrunk down to a little England perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales, and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south by the border the controls that would then be the edge of the European Union.'Dismissing accusations that the Remain campaign had been 'project fear', he insisted that Mr Cameron had a 'duty' to to warn the nation of the dangers of quitting.11.30am: Nigel Farage brandished his passport with EU markings during an appearance in London10.30am: David Cameron was in Bristol at a rally with former Prime Minister Sir John Major and Labour's Harriet HarmanSir John took a swipe at Mr Johnson and Michael Gove, branding them the 'gravediggers of our prosperity'10am: Mr Cameron and Mrs Harman went to the offices of sports distribution firm Shiner in BristolBritish voters were warned there is no chance of a second renegotiation with the EU if they back Brexit yesterday.Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU Commission President, said 'out is out' and ruled out re-opening talks in a bid to reverse a vote to quit the EU.In remarks sure to be seized upon by the Vote Leave campaign, Mr Juncker said David Cameron got the 'maximum' reform possible in his renegotiation that was concluded in February.EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker today claimed David Cameron had already extracted the 'maximum' from the EU Britain would not get any other reforms by voting for Brexit The deal has been derided as empty and useless by Brexit campaigners and the Prime Minister has been forced to admit more reform is still needed.Mr Juncker said yesterday: 'The British policy makers and British voters have to know that there will not be any kind of renegotiation. Out is out.'He added: 'We have concluded a deal with the prime minister.

That does not apply to most countries in the world. We have to defend that principle to our dying day.'He also attacked comments by supporters of Brexit against a health service free on demand.'A vote to leave will put the NHS in jeopardy,' he told the Brighton conference.'The veteran left-winger later addressed a rally in central London. 7am: Boris Johnson kicked off his frenetic last round of campaigning at London's famous Billingsgate Market this morningMichael Gove has made a grovelling apology after comparing pro-EU experts to Nazi propagandists.The Justice Secretary admitted he had been 'clumsy and inappropriate' to make the comments as he dismissed dire forecasts for the consequences of Brexit.The climbdown came after David Cameron branded the remarks a 'massive mistake' and suggested that Mr Gove had 'lost it'.Michael Gove (pictured) compared economic experts warning about the fall-out of Brexit to the Nazis who orchestrated a smear campaign against Albert Einstein in the 1930sRecalling the Nazis' treatment of Jewish scientist Einstein during the 1930s, Mr Gove had told LBC: 'I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and to ask if these arguments are good.'We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his theories were denounced, and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was because he was Jewish.'They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said: 'Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.'''Mr Gove added: 'The truth is that if you look at the quality of the analysis, if you look at the facts on the ground, you can come to an appropriate conclusion.'And the appropriate conclusion, I think, all of us can come to is that with growth rates so low in Europe, with so many unemployed and with the nature of the single currency so damaging, freeing ourselves from that project can only strengthen our economy.'He made his comments after being challenged over why he is not heeding the advice of many economists who have warned that Brexit could have dire consequences and tip the economy into recession.

'Make Thursday our Independence Day!' Boris Johnson issues rallying cry for Brexit after Sadiq Khan accuses him of 'big fat LIES' and running 'Project Hate' in bitter end to brutal EU debate 2016-6-21Boris Johnson last night urged voters to make the EU referendum Britain's 'Independence Day as he was involved in brutal clashes with Sadiq Khan and fellow Tory Ruth Davidson in a crunch TV debate.Mr Johnson laid into the Remain side for 'talking the country down' by issuing a slew of dire Project Fear warnings about the consequences of cutting ties with Brussels.But newly-installed London Mayor Mr Khan hit back by accusing him of telling 'lie after lie' and running 'Project Hate', while Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson lashed out at him for trying to turn the programme into 'the Boris show'.The exchanges came as the sides clashed in a BBC special at Wembley Arena likely to have been watched by millions.Mr Johnson was joined by Tory Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom and Labour's Gisela Stuart for the programme in front of a 6,000 strong live audience.Alongside Mr Khan were Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson and TUC Secretary General Frances O'Grady.Boris Johnson (pictured) said Dyson founder James Dyson was one of many businessmen in favour of Brexit. Sadiq Khan (right) accused the Leave campaign of telling 'lie after lie' The Wembley Arena debate - the last major TV showdown of the campaign - was staged less than 36 hours before voters finally get their say on Britain's membership of the EUDuring the bruising slugfest:Taking to the stage in London last night, Mr Khan said the country would face the 'most important decision for a generation' on Thursday.A Remain vote would mean people are 'both better off and safer'.Audience member Maxine Fothergill said she was a small business owner employing 10 staff and told the panellists that her firm was one of many in the UK that were 'stifled' by EU regulation. Ms Davidson said she knew the EU was 'a bit frustrating but what it means is you cannot be undercut'.She insisted that tariffs and taxes would be increased if we were outside the EU.But Mr Johnson laughed off the idea of tariffs, arguing that Germany sold a fifth of its car output in the UK. ‘I must say that I think that it was extraordinary to hear that we would have tariffs imposed on us because everybody knows that this country receives about a fifth of Germany’s entire car manufacturing output - 820,000 vehicles a year,' he said.The teams are debating Britain's EU membership in front of a massive 6,000 crowdLabour's London Mayor Sadiq Khan is one of the three Remain campaigners taking part last night‘Do you seriously suppose that they are going to be so insane as to allow tariffs to be imposed between Britain and Germany? In some of the most heated scenes of the evening, Ms Davidson accused Mr Johnson of not caring about workers, saying he would not 'guarantee jobs'.But Mr Johnson said: 'They are back to Project Fear within moments. They have nothing positive to say.'Gisela Stuart said it was no surprise that big businesses supported Britain staying in the EU and pointed out that former M&S chief Lord Rose, who admitted wages would go up after a vote to leave the EU.Miranda Grell, who is supporting Remain, said that as a ‘black British woman’ she was grateful to the EU for worker rights introduced by Brussels. She asked the panel: ‘If we leave the EU will this be a slippery slope towards weaker employment and social rights in the UK?’She told viewers: ‘Big companies like Brussels because they're all lobbying to have their rules imposed and you have to comply with them...the chair of the In campaign, Sir Stuart Rose, from M&S said 'it's not going to be a step change or somebody's going to turn the lights out...wages will go up.’ Audience member Miranda Grell, a Remain backer, said that as a ‘black British woman’ she was grateful to the EU for worker rights introduced by Brussels.She asked the panel: ‘If we leave the EU will this be a slippery slope towards weaker employment and social rights in the UK?’ After Mr Johnson claimed that EU membership had stopped the UK Government stepping in to offer assistance to help save the steel plant in Port Talbot earlier this year, Mr Khan shot him down, shouting: ‘One lie after another, after another.’ Boris Johnson lamenting the EU ban on exporting haggis to the US sent Twitter into overdrive Seconds after the debate finished David Cameron tweeted that the Boris Johnson-led Brexit team had shown they had 'no plan' for a post-Brexit BritainMs Stuart denied Ms O’Grady’s charge that only staying in the EU can workers’ rights be protected, but she was pounced on by her Labour colleague Mr Khan.In a bout of red-on-red action, Mr Khan told her: ‘Gisela, you are so wrong. Every time you and I have been in a lobby voting for bills to give workers rights they've been in the other lobby voting against those rights.‘And let me tell you why you’re wrong, because Priti Patel let the mask slip, Priti Patel has said “if we could just halve the burdens of the EU social and employment legislation’.‘And let me tell you what that means, it means rights for mums and dads, that means [giving] rights for part-time workers the same as full-time workers; that means rights for workers whose employers; let me tell you what else.He added: ‘The worst thing for workers is their bosses, business goes out of business, them losing trade and losing jobs. And that’s why we need a healthy economy and Gisa, you should know better.’Ms Stuart shot back: ‘The most important right is the right to a job and as long as we are shackled to a failing Eurozone, liable to bailout after bailout, we will not succeed.’Mr Johnson lamented the fact that Britain could not negotiate its own free trade deals while it remained in the EU and pointed out that the EU had yet to secure free trade arrangements with the US, China and India.Using a Scottish example of why this harmed the British economy, he drew laughter from the 6,000-strong crowd as he told his Ms Davidson: ‘Because the EU is in charge of our trade negotiations we cannot export haggis to America.’In another sign of blue-on-blue infighting during this bitter EU campaign, the Scottish Tory leader shot back: ‘It’s not the Boris show.’ The two sides engaged in angry clashes over immigration and whether Turkey was on an ‘accelerated’ path to join the EU .Mr Khan told the Leave camp: ‘Your campaign hasn’t been Project Fear. It’s been Project Hate as far as immigration is concerned.‘You are telling lies. Turkey is not joining the EU. That is scaremongering Boris. You should be ashamed.’Mr Johnson shot back: ‘The last time I looked it was government policy to accelerate Turkish membership. Is it something they wish to happen in the Year 3,000 or is it something they wish to accelerate? 'I think it is perfectly reasonable to ask people if they would rather proceed on the basis of government promises on immigration or whether they would rather take back control and instigate a points based system so that the electorate can actually hold the government to account.’ Mr Johnson pointed out the current London mayor had previously said that those concerned about immigration should not be accused of prejudice.TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady says remaining in the EU is crucial in the protection of workers' rightsHe added: ‘I am a passionate believer in immigration but it has got to be controlled. When we have numbers running at 184,000 net from the EU, 333,000 net in total and 77,000 coming here without a job it is absolutely time to take back control.’Mr Johnson insisted people should ‘celebrate’ the contribution made by immigrants, but said it was vital to bring their numbers under control.‘Look at the pressure large scale immigration is causing to public services and the downward pressure on wages. And look at the way we are forced to push away many people who might contribute mightily to the NHS,' he added.‘We want an Australian-style points system so we get the people we need.’Sadiq Khan during the debateLondon's Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan took part in last night's debate despite not eating or drinking anything for more than 19 hours as he observed Ramadan.His spokesman confirmed he did not take exceptions even though he was one of the six candidates in the high-stakes referendum campaign - the last major TV debate before Thursday's historic vote.The debate came on the worst possible day for Mr Khan due to the Summer Solstice making it the longest day of the year. Muslims in London are required to fast from 2.40am until 9.24pm.However it didn't stop Mr Khan going after his predecessor as Mayor of London with gusto, accusing Boris Johnson of telling 'lie after lie, after lie' and running 'Project Hate'. Mr Khan became Western Europe's first Muslim Mayor when he beat Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith last month. At the start of Ramadan earlier in June the Labour Mayor said he would use the Muslim holy month to 'get out there and build bridges' between the capital's different communities. Mr Khan said he hoped that having a London Mayor observing Ramadan would help 'break down the mystique and suspicion' that surrounded his faith. At several points during the debate host David Dimbleby had to intervene to try to calm tempers, at one stage telling Mr Khan to 'cool it'. Mrs Leadsom said some of the Remain side’s remarks on immigration were ‘not worthy’ of the debate. She added: ‘Free movement does not even allow us to ask people if they have a criminal record. Free movement is creating enormous problems’. Ms Davidson took her Tory colleague Ms Leadsom to task over Vote Leave’s ‘blatant untruths’.‘I think I need to pick up on something Andrea said because I can’t let it stand that you tell a blatant untruth in the middle of a debate two days before we vote.‘She said 60 per cent of our laws are made in European and it’s simply not true. 13 per cent of our laws, according to the independent House of Commons library that number is 13 per cent. In the last five year parliament it was four – there were four bills out of 121 that came out of Europe.‘I think there’s a real question here, that you’re being asked to make a decision that’s irreversibly, that we can’t change if we wake up on Friday and don’t like it, and we’re being sold it on a lie because they lied about the costs of Europe, they lied about Turkey’s entrance to Europe, they lied about the European army because we have a veto over that.‘They put this on their leaflets and they’ve lied about this tonight too and it’s not good enough because you deserve the truth, you deserve the truth,’ she finished to loud applause and banging from the audience.’Mr Johnson, lashing out at the growing influence of the European Court of Justice, said: ‘Since January 1993 there have been 27 other countries not in the European union that have done better than the United Kingdom in exporting goods into the single market; there have been 21 countries that have done better at exporting services – they include most of the developing economies in the world including India, China and America.‘The best place for us is to be out of the morass, this supreme legal system and I’m afraid Sadiq Khan is completely wrong – the European Court of Justice is the supreme legal authority in our country and he knows that because he’s a lawyer.Challenging Mr Khan directly, Mr Johnson told him: ‘You would not deny that, do you deny it?’ As Mr Khan stood silently by, Mr Johnson added: ‘The European Court of Justice is acquiring steadily more powers and under the Lisbon Treaty the EU expanded competences by about 45 new areas of competence and the European Court of Justice adjudicating in home affairs matters, in deporting foreign suspects, divorce laws for heaven’s sake – things that have nothing to do with the single market.’ Putting the case for Brexit in a rousing final speech, Mr Johnson said: ‘There is a very clear choice between those who speak of nothing but fear about the consequences of leaving the EU, and those on our side who speak of hope.‘They say we cannot do it. We say we can. They say we have no choice but to bend down to Brussels. We say they are woefully underestimating this country and what we can achieve.‘If we vote to leave and take back control, I believe this Thursday could be our country’s independence day.’Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who defected from Leave to Remain last week complaining about claims over what would happen to the NHS outside of the EU, took part in a separate panel discussion on the programme.‘The point is I’ve listened to the evidence and it’s absolutely clear that our NHS, our health research will be hit if we leave this and they’ll be hit because there’ll be less money for our services and because it will hit the workforce and it will hit our leadership role in research and development and cooperation with our European partners,' she said.‘There will be a very serious Brexit penalty for the NHS, make no mistake and if people are caring about the NHS and research when they make their vote I would say vote to remain with our European partners.’  Mr Khan took part in last night's debate despite not eating or drinking anything for more than 19 hours as he observed the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.His spokesman confirmed he did not take exceptions even though he was one of the six candidates in last night's high-stakes referendum campaign - the last major TV debate before Thursday's historic vote.The debate came on the worst possible day for Mr Khan due to the Summer Solstice making it the longest day of the year.Muslims in London required to fast from 2.40am until 9.24pm.Mr Johnson and Ms Davidson did not appear to have taken their on-screen dust up too seriously, and were all smiles after the cameras stopped rollingHowever it didn't stop Mr Khan going after his predecessor as Mayor of London with gusto, accusing Boris Johnson of telling 'lie after lie, after lie' and running 'Project Hate'. Boris vs Ruth on tariffs: 'Do you seriously suppose that they are going to be so insane as to allow tariffs to be imposed between Britain and Germany?'Ruth vs Andrea on Leave: 'We’re being sold it on a lie because they lied about the costs of Europe, they lied about Turkey’s entrance to Europe, they lied about the European army because we have a veto over that.‘They put this on their leaflets and they’ve lied about this tonight too and it’s not good enough because you deserve the truth, you deserve the truth,’ she finished to loud applause and banging from the audience.Sadiq vs Gisela on workers' rights: 'Gisela, you are so wrong. Every time you and I have been in a lobby voting for bills to give workers rights they've been in the other lobby voting against those rights.' Ruth vs Boris on jobs: 'Asked if people were going to lose jobs, Johnson said they might or they might not. That's not good enough.Sadiq vs Boris on immigration: 'Your campaign hasn’t been Project Fear. It’s been Project Hate as far as immigration is concerned.‘You are telling lies. Turkey is not joining the EU. That is scaremongering Boris. You should be ashamed.'Mr Khan became Western Europe's first Muslim Mayor when he beat Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith last month. At the start of Ramadan earlier in June the Labour Mayor said he would use the Muslim holy month to 'get out there and build bridges' between the capital's different communities. Mr Khan said he hoped that having a London Mayor observing Ramadan would help 'break down the mystique and suspicion' that surrounded his faith. Earlier, in an apparent sign of nerves in the Remain camp amid polls showing the outcome is still too close to call, David Cameron issued a desperate plea to older voters not to punish him for mistakes in government by sending Britain crashing out of the EU. Standing outside the famous 10 Downing Street door earlier, the Prime Minister tried to draw a line under another torrid spell of pressure over his failure to curb immigration, insisting that the economic case for membership was 'paramount'.The premier said a vote to leave on Thursday would be 'irreversible'. 'I know I haven't got everything right... but of this I am convinced... Britain is better off inside the EU than out on our own.'Mr Cameron said he wanted to speak directly to 'my generation and older' to think about their children and grandchildren.'I know Europe isn't perfect, believe me I understand and I see those frustrations. I feel them myself,' he said.'That's why we negotiated and enhanced our special status - out of the euro, keeping our borders, not involved in ever closer union. We have the best of both worlds.'So as you take this decision, whether to remain or leave, do think about the hopes and dreams of your children and grandchildren. They know their chances to work, to travel, to build the sort of open and successful society they want to live in rests on this outcome. 'And remember, they can't undo the decision we take. If we vote out, that's it. It is irreversible. We will leave Europe for good.'The next generation will have to live with the consequences far longer than the rest of us.'On Thursday 'it will just be you in that polling booth', he said, 'taking a decision that will affect your future, your children's future, your grandchildren's future'.He added: 'Our economic security is paramount. It will be stronger if we stay; if we leave we will put it at risk.'That is a risk to jobs, a risk to families, a risk to our children's future and there is no going back.' Mr Johnson claimed EU membership had stopped the UK Government stepping in to offer assistance to help save the steel plant in Port Talbot earlier this year. But Mr Khan shot back: ‘One lie after another, after another.’Ruth Davidson, Tory Scottish leader, is a passionate pro-EU campaigner The three Brexiteers taking part in the Wembley Arena debate were, from left to right, Tory MP and former Mayor of London Boris Johnson, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and Tory energy minister Andrea LeadsomData gathered by YouGov for The Times revealed deep splits within Britain on the EU referendum question as different sectors of the population appear set to vote in different ways on Thursday Britain is split down the middle with just two days of the referendum battle to go.As voters prepare to go to the polls on Thursday to decide the future of the nation, YouGov data revealed deep splits across the nation.While London and Scotland break strongly for Remain, Wales, the Midland and the North look set on a Leave vote.Voters aged over 50 are leading the charge for Brexit but those aged 18 to 24 are set to heavily back the campaign to keep Britain inside the EU.The YouGov survey, for The Times, found Leave was slightly ahead at this late stage of the race scoring 44 per cent to Remain's 42 per cent.And a Survation poll also showed support for staying in the EU shrinking, with the Remain campaign ahead of Leave by a margin of just one per cent.But an ORB poll for the Telegraph - focused only on those who say they will definitely turn out on Thursday - found Remain ahead by 6 per cent, scoring 53 per cent to 46 per cent.Lord Sugar slammed for 'utterly unacceptable' claim that Brexit campaigner 'shouldn't tell us British what we should do' because she's from GermanyInfighting has broken out in the Remain campaign after pro-EU Apprentice boss Lord Sugar said a Brexit campaigner should not 'tell us British what we should do' because she is from Germany.He was attacking Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who is from Bavaria and moved to Britain in 1974 and was representing the Brexit camp in the last major TV debate before Thursday's referendum.James McGrory, the spokesman for the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, said his remarks were 'utterly unacceptable'.It was an extraordinary outbreak of infighting within the Remain campaign just hours before polls open in Britain's first referendum on EU membership in 41 years.Ms Stuart, now a British citizen, was representing the Leave campaign alongside Boris Johnson and Tory minister Andrea Leadsom in front of 6,000 people at a high-stakes debate Wembley Arena.Businessman and Remain backer Lord Sugar took exception at her appearance in the debate, tweeting: 'I find it strange that Gisela Gschaider a 1974 immigrant from Germany is on the Brexit panel telling us British what we should do.'Tory MP and Leave backer Nadhim Zahawi took exception to the remarks, saying: 'You must withdraw and apologise to Gisela. That is disgraceful. She is as British as you are'James McGrory, the spokesman for the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, said Lord Sugar's remarks were 'utterly unacceptable' Businessman and Remain backer Lord Sugar took exception at her appearance in the debate, tweeting: 'I find it strange that Gisela Gschaider a 1974 immigrant from Germany is on the Brexit panel telling us British what we should do.'He added: 'She immigrated to UK from Germany in 1974. 30 mins ago was advocating that we stop immigration from the EU.'And after one of his Twitter followers branded him a 'racist', Lord Sugar replied: 'You ignorant fool. How can my comment be classified as racist. Crawl back under your rock'.Lord Sugar again insisted he was not being racist, pointing out that Ms Stuart is an immigrant who is now arguing against immigration.In a series of tweets, he said: 'Yes she is (British) now, and has been arguing that we need to curb immigrants from the EU. She immigrated to UK from Germany in 1974.Tory MP and Leave backer Nadhim Zahawi took exception to the remarks, saying: 'You must withdraw and apologise to Gisela. That is disgraceful. She is as British as you are.'And former Tory MP Louise Mensch tweeted: '@Lord-Sugar PIG'.But it was the condemnation of the official Remain campaign that will do the most damage to Lord Sugar.Mr McGrory tweeted: 'This is utterly unacceptable. I couldn't disagree with Gisela Stuart more but she has every right to say her piece.' It's all fun and games! Boris Johnson and Ruth Davidson embrace minutes after mauling each other over Haggis in bruising EU referendum debate Boris Johnson and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson embraced just minutes after mauling each other in a bruising final EU debate last night.The Tory pair repeatedly clashed in the two-hour debate at Wembley Arena, with pro-EU Ms Davidson interrupting Mr Johnson mid-sentence to tell viewers: 'It isn't the Boris show.She accused his Brexit campaign of lying and echoed Tom Cruise as she told voters: 'You deserve the truth'. But getting his own back, Mr Johnson used a Scottish example to attack Ms Davidson's argument for staying in the EU.He drew laughter from the 6,000-strong crowd as he told her: ‘Because the EU is in charge of our trade negotiations we cannot export haggis to America.’Boris Johnson (right) hugs Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson (left) despite the pair repeatedly clashing during in the two-hour debate at Wembley Arena last nightBut as soon as the cameras had stopped rolling, the two rivals - who have both been tipped as future Tory leaders - were seen smiling as they hugged each other on stage.Ms Davidson, a keen kick-boxer who announced her engagement to partner Jennifer Wilson last month, also laid into her Tory colleague Andrea Leadsom, another Brexit panelist.She took Ms Leadsom to task over Vote Leave's claim that 60 per cent of our laws originate from Brussels.‘I think I need to pick up on something Andrea said because I can’t let it stand that you tell a blatant untruth in the middle of a debate two days before we vote,' she said in yet another example of a blue-on-blue attack.‘She said 60 per cent of our laws are made in European and it’s simply not true. 13 per cent of our laws, according to the independent House of Commons library that number is 13 per cent. In the last five year parliament it was four – there were four bills out of 121 that came out of Europe.Ms Davidson added: ‘I think there’s a real question here, that you’re being asked to make a decision that’s irreversibly, that we can’t change if we wake up on Friday and don’t like it, and we’re being sold it on a lie because they lied about the costs of Europe, they lied about Turkey’s entrance to Europe, they lied about the European army because we have a veto over that.‘They put this on their leaflets and they’ve lied about this tonight too and it’s not good enough because you deserve the truth, you deserve the truth,’ she finished to loud applause and banging from the audience.’Queen said to have been asking dinner guests for 'three good reasons' why Britain should be in EUThe Queen is said to have been asking dinner guests to give her 'three good reasons' why Britain should be in the EU.Royal author Robert Lacey claimed the monarch has been posing the question to those she entertains privately.In an article for The Daily Beast website, Mr Lacey wrote: '"Give me three good reasons," she has apparently been asking her dinner companions recently, "why Britain should be part of Europe?"'A Buckingham Palace spokesman said it would not comment on private conversations.Buckingham Palace said it did not comment on private conversations and the Queen was 'above politics''The Queen is above politics and acts on the advice of her Government in political matters,' the spokesman said.'The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.'Sources pointed out that Mr Lacey did not seem to have heard the question himself, and stressed that there was no claim that the monarch had offered her own views.The Sun was rebuked by the press regulator in March for suggesting that the Queen favoured leaving the EU.Asked about the article today, Mr Lacey said: 'The Queen likes a healthy debate around the dinner table. It was just a question.'She's aware of the complexities for different parts of the UK.'As we know, she's very careful not to betray whatever her personal opinions may be on this. You can say the same of her husband.'The claim has emerged at a crucial time in the EU referendum battle, with less than 36 hours to go until the nation votes.  

'Brexit will mean Black Friday for Britain': Billionaire George Soros says pound fall after Leave vote would be bigger than 'Black Wednesday'2016-6-20Billionaire financier George Soros, who earned fame for betting against the pound in 1992, said that a vote for Brexit would trigger a 'Black Friday'A Brexit vote on Thursday could produce a 'Black Friday' as markets react in horror to instability caused by the result, a billionaire who famously bet against the pound and won in the 1992 crash warned today.George Soros forced then prime minister John Major to pull Britain out of the 'European Exchange Rate Mechanism' in 1992, sparking chaos in the markets on a day that went down in history as 'Black Wednesday'.Mr Soros today claimed the collapse in the value of the pound on Friday could be even bigger if Britain votes for Brexit and he warned it would leave people poorer.Currency and stock markets have been on a roller-coaster ride during the referendum campaigning, plunging over the past fortnight as a succession of polls showed a Brexit lead.But as market hopes of a Remain vote were raised yesterday, the FTSE100 index soared and the pound had one of its strongest days since the 2008 financial crisis.Chancellor George Osborne doubled down on his succession of grim economic warnings over Brexit last night as he refused to rule out that the stock market could even need to be suspended on Friday.And Mr Osborne - who last week said an 'emergency budget' featuring punishing tax rises and spending cuts would be needed after Brexit - even claimed redundancies could be made by the end of the week.Mr Soros' warning today could send new shudders through markets today as opinion polls show a race which is going down to the wire.  Mr Soros used Quantum Fund in 1992 to bet successfully that sterling was overvalued against the Deutsche Mark.Writing in the Guardian, Mr Soros said after Brexit, the pound would fall by at least 15 percent, and possibly more than 20 per cent, to below $1.15 from its current level of around $1.46.He said: 'The value of the pound would decline precipitously.'It would also have an immediate and dramatic impact on financial markets, investment, prices and jobs.'I would expect this devaluation to be bigger and also more disruptive than the 15 percent devaluation that occurred in September 1992, when I was fortunate enough to make a substantial profit for my hedge fund investors.'Chancellor George Osborne, pictured yesterday after a remembrance service for Jo Cox, last night refused to rule out closing the stock market on Friday in reaction to a Brexit vote Mr Soros, ranked as the world's 23rd richest person by Forbes magazine with a fortune of $24.9 billion, said the Bank of England would not cut rates after a British exit.He warned there would be few monetary policy tools left to ease a recession or a fall in British house prices.He also pointed to the 'very large' current account deficit in the United Kingdom and said a post-Brexit devaluation would be unlikely to improve manufacturing as trading conditions would be too uncertain to undertake new investments or hire workers.Hungarian-born Mr Soros said the scale of the sterling devaluation would compare with 1967, when then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson devalued the pound to $2.40 from $2.80.Speculators, Mr Soros said, would be eager to exploit a Brexit situation to profit.He said: 'Today, there are speculative forces in the markets much bigger and more powerful.'And they will be eager to exploit any miscalculations by the British government or British voters.'Brexit would make some people very rich - but most voters considerably poorer.Members of Britain's Leave campaign say some bankers, big companies and politicians are trying to scare British voters with overblown warnings about the financial and economic impact of a Brexit.Opponents of EU membership say Britain could prosper if it cut itself free from what they portray as a doomed German-dominated project in excessive debt-funded welfare spending.Mr Soros warned today that Brexit would 'make some people very rich - but most voters considerably poorer'The world's biggest banks including Citi and Goldman Sachs will draft in senior traders to work through the night following Britain's referendum on EU membership, set to be among the most volatile 24 hours for markets in a quarter of a century.A vote to leave the European Union on June 23 would spook investors by undermining post-World War Two attempts at European integration and placing a question mark over the future of the United Kingdom and its $2.9 trillion economy.Citi, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are among those banks planning to have senior staff and traders working or on call in London as results start to dribble in after polls close at 10pm, according to sources.'British voters are now grossly underestimating the true costs of Brexit,' Soros added.'Too many believe that a vote to leave the EU will have no effect on their personal financial position. This is wishful thinking.'

Tate & Lyle tells staff they should consider voting to leave: Sugar giant warns employees its future could be threatened if Britain remains in the EU2016-6-22One of Britain’s best-known companies last night warned staff its future could be placed under threat if we remain in the EU.In a highly unusual move,  Tate & Lyle Sugars wrote to its 800 UK staff warning that ‘EU restrictions and tariffs’ had added £30 million to its raw material costs last year.This turned ‘what should have been a good profit, that we would all share, into a £19 million loss’, the firm said.Gerald Mason (right, with  Zac Goldsmith, centre, on a visit) told staff that EU tariffs on a single boatload of cane sugar could top £2.5 million. In a highly unusual move, sugar giant Tate & Lyle (pictured, north London) wrote to its 800 UK staff warning that ‘EU restrictions and tariffs’ had added £30 million to its raw material costs last year.The company’s senior vice-president Gerald Mason told staff that EU tariffs on a single boatload of cane sugar could top £2.5 million.He said the situation was made worse by the fact that Brussels officials ‘then send that money to subsidise our beet sugar-producing competitors in Europe’.In a further damaging blow to David Cameron, Britain’s leading entrepreneur Sir James Dyson last night stepped up his call for Britain to leave the EU, warning that remaining in the Brussels club would be ‘an act of national self-harm’.Sir James said the Prime Minister’s claim that Britain could go on to reform the EU was ‘pure fantasy’.And he warned that the EU’s free movement rules had created an immigration system that made ‘no economic or moral sense’.He went on: ‘There is a perception that having a seat at the EU table means Britain has influence. As David Cameron discovered in his recent attempt at renegotiation, we don’t.‘There are 27 other countries at the same table with their own conflicting interests. It’s ungovernable and undemocratic. To think we can reform Brussels is arrogant and delusional - it is pure fantasy.’The entrepreneur added: ‘I can confirm that we have no influence whatsoever in the shaping of Europe’s protectionist laws and regulations. Believe me, we’ve tried.‘Consider immigration, which the United Kingdom should benefit from greatly. We need immigration, but we also need to be able to control it.In a further damaging blow to David Cameron, Britain’s leading entrepreneur Sir James Dyson last night stepped up his call for Britain to leave the EU‘It makes no economic or moral sense to ignore the world beyond Europe. Yet, we are forced to accept people from Europe without limit, while turning away economically vital engineers and scientists from the rest of the world.‘This is the last opportunity to regain control of our futures. If we vote Remain, make no mistake, we lose control. This would be an act of national self-harm.’The interventions threatened to overshadow a fresh effort by Downing Street to claim that business opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU.Hundreds of businesses are expected to sign a No 10-inspired letter today warning that Brexit ‘would lead to uncertainty and put jobs at risk’.But Boris Johnson yesterday accused the PM of using Government contracts and the promise of honours to persuade business leaders to back his campaign to keep Britain in the EU.Mr Johnson said Eurosceptic business leaders were being ‘leaned on’ to keep their views quiet, while waverers were being tempted with the offer of rewards.Speaking to LBC Radio, Mr Johnson said: ‘I can’t tell you the pressure that Project Fear and Remain put on senior business people not to articulate their views. Everyone has an interest in keeping friendly with government.’Asked about the kind of pressure Downing Street was exerting, Mr Johnson replied: ‘I do not wish in anyway to be disparaging or critical of my friends in Government.“But it is well-known that there is an operation in Downing Street and you will get a call from certain gentlemen, whose names you can discover.‘And they will say, “look, you know, we want to continue to have contracts with you. It’s very important that we want to continue friendly relationships, there is an honours system as you know”, all this kind of thing. And that’s how it is. There is a bit of leaning on.’Earlier this month, Mr Cameron was accused of ‘borderline corruption’ after using the Queen’s birthday honours to shower gongs on business leaders and luvvies who backed his campaign to keep Britain in the EU.At least 20 prominent Remain supporters were rewarded with honours, including five company chiefs whose firms signed a previous pro-Brussels letter to the Times, six who signed a similar letter from entrepreneurs to the Financial Times and four members of the ‘creative industries’ who signed a No 10-inspired open letter backing the case for staying in the EU.Recipients included Innocent drinks founder Richard Reed, who is deputy chairman of the official In campaign, Britain Stronger in Europe. Mr Reed, who describes the EU as ‘fantastic’, was rewarded with a CBE.Downing Street denied handing out honours in return for support in the bitter referendum battle, saying a small number of Brexit supporters had also been honoured.But No 10 does not deny orchestrating a series of letters designed to give the impression that business opinion is overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU.Tate and Lyle Sugars backed the Vote Leave campaign led by Boris Johnson, pictured, because of the impact of EU rules adding to the cost of the business Downing Street aides have spent the last week twisting the arms of senior business figures to sign another open letter backing Britain’s EU membership.An activist at the official Britain Stronger in Europe campaign has circulated business leaders with an email asking them to sign the letter which claims that leaving the EU ‘would mean uncertainty for our firms, less trade with Europe and fewer jobs’.She identifies herself as ‘a special adviser to the Prime Minister (who is) now working for the campaign’.Mr Cameron has also been piling pressure on wavering Tory MPs to speak out against Brexit.In a series of one-to-one meetings, he has stressed the risk that Brexit could gridlock the Government for years.One MP reported that the Prime Minister’s final plea had been: ‘You don’t really want three years of Euro-w**k, do you?’Three more Conservative MPs fell in behind the PM yesterday - Jackie Doyle-Price (Thurrock), Caroline Nokes (Romsey and Southampton North) and David Tredinnick (Bosworth).But Bristol North West MP Charlotte Leslie said she had decided to back Brexit.Nick Herbert, chairman of Conservatives In, said a ‘clear majority’ of Tory MPs now back Remain, with 185 saying they want to stay in, compared with 143 backing Brexit.Meanwhile, Michael Gove has compared economic experts warning about Brexit to Nazis who rubbished Albert Einstein’s scientific findings during the 1930s.Mr Gove has faced criticism for saying voters have had enough of listening to economic experts issuing doom-laden warnings about Brexit.Asked about the comments last night, he told LBC: ‘I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and to ask if these arguments are good.‘We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his theories were denounced and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was because he was Jewish.‘They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said, “Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough”.’ 

If you vote Leave, you won't kick the establishment in the b***s... you'll shoot yourself in the foot: RICHARD BRANSON on why he's voting Remain 2016-6-19In almost 50 years of business, I have launched hundreds of new ventures. There is an enormous thrill in starting something from scratch – the excitement of entering a new market, of building a team, the fun of disrupting the status quo.Over the years I’ve had to take many leaps of faith as we moved into fields we knew little about. I signed an unknown musician named Mike Oldfield and created my own record label because I’d never before heard anything quite like Tubular Bells.I convinced Boeing to lease me a jumbo jet to start a single-plane airline from London to New York, because I knew there was a gap in the market for an airline that really cared. I ordered tilting trains when we did not have a track ready to run them on, because it would eventually speed up journeys.I am one of a rare breed of business people still going who can remember what it was like before the European Union was formed. When I took my first steps in business in the 1960s and 70s, trade and travel were a dragBut no matter what the challenge – and there were many we got wrong too – I always made sure I understood the downside risks involved before I leapt in. Today, the UK faces a decision where the risks are great. My reputation is of being a risk-taker – the cat with nine lives – but leaving the European Union is not a risk I would want to take. Not as an investor, not as an entrepreneur and certainly not as a father and grandfather concerned about the world we leave to the next generation.I am one of a rare breed of business people still going who can remember what it was like before the European Union was formed. When I took my first steps in business in the 1960s and 70s, trade and travel were a drag.In those days I couldn’t move my people between Britain and continental Europe without visas and months and months of trying to get permission. I couldn’t move goods between Britain and Europe without high taxes and the enormous bureaucracy that went with it.But over the past decades, the European Union has knocked down those barriers and made it easier for UK companies to expand abroad. They can trade without tariffs or taxes.People can live, work, and travel wherever they please within the Common Market. And thousands have seized the opportunity to study abroad, whether in Barcelona, Berlin or Budapest.Although I personally have lived overseas for some years now, Virgin businesses employ nearly 50,000 people in the UK and these British businesses trade around the globe. We’re not alone. Up to three million British jobs are linked to the UK’s membership of the world’s largest single market – a market of more than 500 million consumers, offering unparalleled opportunities for investment and trade. Almost half of all British exports go to other EU countries. That could change quickly.Those polled thought Prime Minister David Cameron has had the best referendum campaign so farBrexit would deal a devastating blow to the UK’s economy, killing many jobs and hitting the strength of the pound. Some say leaving is about sovereignty. Well, if the goal is to stay in Europe’s Economic Area and to reap the benefits of free trade, the UK would still have to play by the same rules and pay into the pot. Yet, the Government would not have a seat at the table when the rules are made. That’s not what I’d call sovereignty. That’s a bad idea.Bear in mind that even the UK’s trade with the rest of the world benefits from dozens of trade agreements the EU has negotiated. Painstakingly, I should add.Renegotiating those agreements would be complex and onerous. Why? Because the rest of the world would much rather have access to a market of 500 million than one of 64 million. That’s not fear-mongering but common sense. The global market is competitive enough as it is. Why set up more obstacles?Brexit raises other key questions: would UK citizens ever enjoy visa and passport-free movement across Europe again? What about the status of the estimated two million EU nationals working in the UK, quite a few of them for Virgin businesses? Where should they go?Even under the terms granted to Switzerland and Norway, freedom of movement is not negotiable. Nor should it be. Study after study has shown that the effect of European immigration on the UK is a positive one, as immigrants tend to contribute more to the country than they take out. Blaming breakdowns in public services on them is not just disingenuous. It’s a myth.Only 10 per cent of voters think Nigel Farage has had a good campaign while 43 per cent think this poster depicting migrants was inflammatory with less than a third thinking it was fair Britain’s universities – among the best in the world – will be affected. They produce ground-breaking research and world-class innovation. Much of that relies on EU funding, about £500 million every year. Brexit would seriously limit the flow of funding, risking a brain drain of the UK’s best minds to other countries. One of the EU’s most important achievements is that its members no longer go to war with each other. I lived in the UK for five decades and represent the first generation of my family not to fight on European battlefields, as my father and grandfather did.Instead I was able to become an entrepreneur, thanks to a new vision of peaceful partnership between Europe’s nations – one built on trade, openness and collaboration. Even Winston Churchill was a fan.As early as 1946, he called for a ‘United States of Europe’, where millions will ‘be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living’. Nobody is perfect, but Europe’s institutions have delivered on this promise.There are few occasions in your life where you can see things going horribly wrong. This is one of those occasions, where the wrong decision will do irreparable damage both to Britain and to Europe.Some people think that by voting Leave they will somehow punish the ruling class. Some are looking backwards and inwards for inspiration and hope – when they should be looking forward at a wide world of opportunity. If you vote Leave you are not kicking the establishment in the b***s – you are shooting yourself in the foot.The global threats facing British citizens young and old, like climate change, financial crisis or conflict, are best addressed collectively. No question, being part of the EU not only makes Europe stronger, but the UK too. June 23 will determine if voters would rather live in Little England or in Great Britain.And Great Britain has always stood for democracy, compassion, justice and inclusion. Let the arguments of the day not diminish its place in the world. If you agree with me, I’d urge you to vote Remain.

Furious EU leader demands Britain makes quick exit after claiming the Tory party feud held 'a whole continent hostage' 2016-6-24European leaders have warned Britain to leave the EU quickly and avoid prolonging uncertainty.The presidents of the EU's main institutions said in a statement today that they expect London to act on the decision to leave 'as soon as possible, however painful that process may be.'As he demanded Britain make a quick exit from the EU, furious European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the U.K.'s relationship with the EU had been ambiguous, but was 'now clear.'He added a prolonged exit was 'the opposite of what we need', adding that it was difficult to accept that 'a whole continent is taken hostage because of an internal fight in the Tory party'. European Parliament President Martin Schulz has said Europe must not be 'held hostage' by BritainFrench President Francois Hollande said the UK's vote to leave the EU must act as a 'jolt' to the bloc to implement the 'profound change' needed to address its troublesEuropean Council leader Donald Tusk has led the stunned continent's reaction to Brexit insisting: 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'Merkel expressed 'great regret' at the UK's decision to leave the European Union and said the bloc must never forget that the foundation of European unity was the 'idea of peace'French President Francois Hollande has admitted the EU requires 'profound change' in the wake of the Brexit vote as German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her dismay at the result.Hollande said the UK's vote to leave the EU must act as a 'jolt' to the bloc to implement the change needed to address its troubles - adding he was 'sad' to see Britain sever relations.Merkel described her 'great regret' at the UK's decision to leave and said the EU must never forget that the foundation of European unity was the 'idea of peace'. The four - EU Council President Donald Tusk, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Parliament President Martin Schulz and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte - said that 'any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty.'David Cameron has suggested that formal notification of Britain's departure might not come before October.On Monday, Merkel and Hollande will meet to discuss the vote with Donald Tusk, who earlier insisted: 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger'.Newspapers and politicians across Europe have revealed their shock at Britain's decision - just a day after many pleaded with the UK to stay. The French President warned the remaining 27 member states that action was needed to reconnect with citizens. 'The British people have decided to leave. It is a sad decision but one which I respect,' he said.'The vote puts the European Union in difficulties. It must recognise its shortfalls.'A jolt is necessary. Europe must reaffirm it values of freedom, solidarity, peace. The EU must be understood and controlled by its citizens. I will do everything to secure profound change rather than decline.'The International Monetary Fund 'stands ready' to deal with the fallout of the UK's decision to leave the European Union, according to its managing director Christine LagardeEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) insisted on Friday that Britain's decision to leave the EU was not the beginning of the end for the blocMerkel later warned EU member states against drawing hasty conclusions about Britain's decision to quit the bloc, as that risked further splitting Europe.'We take note of the British people's decision with regret. There is no doubt that this is a blow to Europe and to the European unification process,' she said.But 'what the consequences of this would be... would depend on whether we - the other 27 member states of the EU - prove to be willing and able to not draw quick and simple conclusions from the referendum in Great Britain, which would only further divide Europe,' said Merkel.Member states should 'calmly and prudently analyse and evaluate the situation, before making the right decisions together,' said Merkel.  Tusk had earlier pleaded for the EU 'to keep our unity as 27' adding that Britain's 'historic' vote to leave the European Union should not provoke 'hysterical reactions'. Voters in the UK clearly backed Brexit despite polls previously predicting that the country would remain within the bloc.Tusk said Britain's 'historic' vote to leave the European Union should not provoke 'hysterical reactions' and added that the EU was prepared for such an outcomeSpeaking in Brussels on Friday, Tusk said he was confident in the EU's future, adding that 'what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.' The European Council leader said:  'I am fully aware of how serious, or even dramatic, this moment is politically.'There's no way of predicting all the political consequences of this event, especially for the UK. But for sure this is not a moment for hysterical reactions. I want to reassure everyone that we are prepared also for this negative scenario. As you know the EU is not only a fair-weather project.'Today, on behalf of the twenty seven leaders I can say that we are determined to keep our unity as 27. For all of us, the union is the framework for our common future. I would also like to reassure you that there will be no legal vacuum.'He said that EU law 'will continue to apply to and within the UK' until Britain has formally left the bloc. 'Until the United Kingdom formally leaves the European Union, EU law will continue to apply to and within the UK. By this , I mean rights and obligations. He added: 'Finally, it's true that the past years have been the most difficult ones in the history of our Union. But I always remember what my father used to tell me: What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.'  Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he 'deeply regretted' the decision but 'European co-operation will have to continue'European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker insisted on Friday that Britain's decision to leave the EU was not the beginning of the end for the bloc. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said Britain's exit from the EU must be done quickly.Schulz tweeted on Friday that the 'will of voters must be respected. Now need speedy and clear exit negotiation.'He says the U.K.'s relationship with the EU had been ambiguous but that 'now it's clear.'Britain has up to two years to negotiate an exit, but EU officials have been insisting on quick and potentially tough negotiations to discourage the 27 other countries in the bloc from wanting to leave. The heads of the European Greens party say the European Union needs a reset with the vote to leave in Britain showing that the EU is more divided than ever. Joint chairs Monica Frassoni and Reinhard Buetikofer say Friday that 'Europe is more divided and less colourful' and that 'we cannot go on with business as usual.'They said: 'We need to 'reset' the EU and together make it able to deliver credible solutions, notably to those facing a persistent economic uncertainty and a growing sense of insecurity.' As leaders across Europe woke up to the news, France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen changed her Twitter picture to a Union Jack and told her followers the result was 'victory for freedom'.'As I have been asking for years, we must now have the same referendum in France and EU countries,' she wrote.As leaders across Europe woke up to the news, France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen changed her Twitter picture to a Union Jack and told her followers the result was 'victory for freedom'France: However, prominent French far right politician Marion Le Pen declared that the British result was a victoryGermany: The vice chancellor of Germany Sigmar Gabriel was quick to tweet his dismay and the result saying: 'Damn! bad day for Europe!'Italian Premier Matteo Renzi insisted it was time for 'calm and lucidity' so Europe can set to work restructuring.Renzi said 'Europe is our home' and 'that of our children and grandchildren.' He added that, today more than ever, 'the house must be remodeled, maybe freshened up, but it's the house of our tomorrow.' He said Europe's young people are asking for 'more Europe' to realise dreams and expectations.Many Italian college graduates, unable to find jobs at home, head to Britain to pursue research or careers in finance and other fields.Renzi recalled that 'in moments of difficulty, Europe pulls out the best of itself.' Margus Tsahkna, of Estonia’s centre-right coalition said Britain had started the break up of Europe and that Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘is drinking champagne’.European citizens also vented their anger on Twitter, with digs from the French towards ‘Les Anglais’. Many used the hashtag #BonDebarras – good riddance – and one said: ‘The English vote like they cook, it’s diabolical.France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen changed her Twitter picture to a Union Jack and told her followers the result was 'victory for freedom'. This morning, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, a member of the Le Pen dynasty and an FN MP,  tweeted 'Victory!'The Le Pens, including the convicted racist and anti-Semite MEP and party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, are fiercely anti-Europe.They view an end to the EU as the best way of implementing their anti-immigration and anti-globalisation agenda. Germany: Tabloid newspaper Bild expressed their shock at the result with a picture of dejected Remain campaigners with the headline 'Britain OUT' France: Liberation featured the picture of a married couple on top of a wedding cake holding Union flags saying 'Britain opts to leave' French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said he was 'sad for the United Kingdom' and that 'Europe will continue but it must react and rediscover the confidence of its peoples.

A bad day for Europe!' Germany's foreign minister said Britain's decision to leave the European Union is 'truly sobering' news.Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that 'it looks like a sad day for Europe and for the United Kingdom.'German officials have repeatedly said that they wanted Britain to remain in the EU. Denmark: Politiken also opted for a picture of two dejected Remain supporters holding their heads in shock Belgium: The website of national newspaper Le Soir also chose to illustrate their shock at the result chosing a picture of a Remain supporters looking worried Italy: Corriere della Serra were running a Brexit special and summed up their coverage with a picture of a jubilant Nigel Farage Meanwhile former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb predicted the result would mean chaos on the continent.He wrote on Twitter: 'Please tell me I'm still sleeping and this is all just a bad nightmare!'Usually these things advance in three stages 1.

'It's a great thing. The UK public have taken back their country': Trump praises Britain for voting to leave EU as he says it's 'too bad' that Cameron has resigned2016-6-23Presidential hopeful Donald Trump said it is a 'great thing' that the people of the UK have 'taken back their country' in voting to leave the EU, as he touched down at his golf resort in Scotland today.The billionaire arrived in his 'Trump'-emblazoned helicopter at the Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire with his family to officially open the revamped resort he bought in 2014, just an hour after Prime Minister David Cameron said he intended to stand down in October.When asked his opinion on David Cameron announcing he is to step down, Trump said: 'Well, that's too bad.' While he was speaking at the ninth hole of his golf course, the billionaire was interrupted by British comedian/prankster Lee Nelson, who held up several swastika-emblazoned golf balls and tried to hand them out to the crowd. Scroll down for video Donald Trump arrived in Scotland to visit his Turnberry golf resort. He was joined by his daughter Ivanka (left) and sons Don Jr and EricThe Donald praised his mother, who was born in Scotland, his children who manage his business affairs and the golf course itself, dismissing complaints from Republicans that he should stick to the campaign trail at home.

I forgot to hand them out!' Earlier, Trump had given a thumbs-up as he left his helicopter and shook hands with workers on his way to the hotel before making the comments about the EU referendum result.Asked about the British vote, Trump said: 'They took back control of their country. It's a great thing.' British comedian/prankster Lee Nelson held up some swastika-emblazoned golf balls while Trump gave a speech on the ninth holeNelson, real name Simon Brodkin, hit the headlines last year when he showered former Fifa president Sepp Blatter with fake money.

His proximity to Trump (circled) can be seen aboveThe people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples. They have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy. A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense. The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration.Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first. They will have the chance to reject today’s rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.I hope America is watching, it will soon be time to believe in America again.'People are angry, all over the world, they're angry,' he said. 'They're angry over borders, they're angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are. They're angry about many, many things.' Meanwhile, Trump posted a statement on Facebook promising close ties between the U.S. and UK if he becomes President, saying: 'A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense'. Asked if he meant in the United States or United Kingdom, Trump said: 'There's plenty of other places. This will not be the last.' And speaking at a press conference at the golf course today, he said: 'This is a very historic day for a lot of reasons - not only for Turnberry. This is one of the big votes in the history of Europe, Scotland, everywhere. So I wish everyone a lot of luck.' Hundreds of campaigners hope to create havoc by besieging the Trump Turnberry Hotel, while a plane trailing a banner with the message 'Love Trumps Hate' will greet the controversial billionaire's arrival. And now that Britain has voted to leave the European Union after a historic referendum, Mr Trump could be met with another layer of resentment.While Scots voted overwhelmingly for remaining part of the EU, voters in England and Wales swung the result for Leave. Hundreds of campaigners hope to create havoc by besieging the Trump Turnberry Hotel, while a plane trailing a banner with the message 'Love Trumps Hate' will greet the controversial billionaire's arrivalThe billionaire arrived in his 'Trump' emblazoned helicopter at the Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire to officially open the revamped resort he bought in 2014, just an hour after Prime Minister David Cameron said he intended to stand down in OctoberAs the result sent the financial markets into meltdown, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said that the decision would 'create a sense of shock in Britain's boardrooms'. Upon his arrival, Mr Trump was greeted by a pair of bagpipers and dozens of resort staff members wearing 'Make Turnberry Great Again' hats. This is Trump's first international trip since sealing sufficient delegate support to be the GOP standard-bearer this autumn. The timing of the trip has raised eyebrows among some fellow Republicans as it comes amid a rocky stretch for his campaign.Trump isn't slated to meet with any political leaders while in Scotland.The tycoon arrived for the reopening of Trump Turnberry following a £200million ($270m) refurbishment. But police have tightened security after the Scotland Against Trump group announced it would be running bus-loads of protesters to the invitation-only event.Trump was greeted by supporters before he made his comments on the EU referendum resultUpon his arrival, Mr Trump was greeted by a pair of bagpipers and dozens of resort staff members wearing 'Make Turnberry Great Again' hatsThe presumptive Republican nominee for US president landed in Scotland today surrounded by his family - son Eric Trump (r), granddaughter Kai Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump (l)Mr Trump has stoked up inter-national fury after proposing policies including building a wall across the US border with Mexico and temporarily banning Muslims from entering America.A second group, Stand Up To Trump, claims the presumptive Republican candidate is not welcome here after he 'ramped up levels of racism, Islamophobia, and bigotry' during his presidential bid. It has gathered almost 587,000 signatures on a petition calling for him to be banned from entering the UK. Twitter reaction to Trump's views on Britain voting to leave EUA small group of anti-Trump protesters gathered near the golf course in South AyrshireTrump Turnberry has been hit with a series of poor reviews ahead of its grand opening today.More than a quarter of those who have posted reviews of the resort on TripAdvisor have rated their stay as either 'poor' or 'terrible'.Although the resort is not officially open, the reviews are thought to have been left since its non-official 'soft' reopening on June 1.One British tourist rated his stay last week with one star out of five, saying he was not allowed to check in until 11pm and served a 'terrible meal'. He also claimed his room had no curtains or blinds.He added: 'The setting of the hotel and the sunsets are all just so special that if the management get this hotel right, they get the right chef and management, then this will be one of the best in the world.'So please sort it out. Sorry is just not good enough, I am sorry to say.'A visitor from New York, who was also there last week, rated his stay 'poor'. He admitted that the redesigned golf course was 'one of the best in the world' – but said he had to wait 75 minutes for a meal in an empty restaurant.A tourist from Wisconsin rated the hotel as 'poor', adding that he 'would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone else'.In spite of the low-scoring reviews, however, a number of guests have awarded the destination five-star reviews since it was reopened.A spokesman for the resort said: 'Trump Turnberry is one of the world's most opulent luxury retreats and we pride ourselves on the quality of our service.'We expect every guest to thoroughly enjoy their experience with us.'When issues do arise, as can happen at any hotel, we taken even the smallest concern extremely seriously.'Mr Trump endorsed Brexit at the start of June, making his strongest intervention yet by saying voters should support the Leave campaign.He had already been engaged in a war of words with David Cameron over his policy on Muslims after the Prime Minister branded him 'stupid' in the House of Commons.Cameron had attempted to build bridges with the presumptive nominee ahead of his official confirmation as the Republican candidate at the party convention next month.Mr Trump previously said he would be tempted by Brexit if he was a British voter but then went further in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in early June.Asked whether he would back Brexit, Mr Trump appeared confused by the term before adding: 'Oh yeah, I think they should leave.'After a ribbon-cutting ceremony this morning, Mr Trump will then fly north to Aberdeenshire tomorrow to visit the course he opened in 2012. He was able to do so after winning a bitterly fought battle to bulldoze coastal dunes which were legally protected because of their ecological value and rarity.There will be little respite from protests, however, as two of his neighbours and bitterest foes – David Milne and Michael Forbes – have erected Mexican flags on their homes in plain view of Mr Trump's clubhouse and golf course 'to show solidarity with the Mexican people'.Among the organisations objecting to Mr Trump's visit are Stand Up to Racism Scotland, the Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees and Unite the Union Scotland.Keir McKechnie, spokesman for Stand Up to Racism Scotland, said: 'His message of hate is one that we'll challenge and we would not encourage anyone to support him in his presidency.'Although this protest happens to be taking place in Scotland, we want to represent people across the whole of the UK and beyond who reject Trump's racism and Islamophobia.'A separate group, 38 Degrees, is behind plans to fly a plane trailing an anti-Trump message over Turnberry around midday during the resort's reopening ceremony.Almost 14,000 members of the group have signed a petition calling on Mr Trump to meet Edinburgh's Muslim leaders 'to educate himself about the religion'.Kathryn Stribley of 38 Degrees said: 'Donald Trump's views have shown him to be way out of line with the values that 38 Degrees members – and most people across the UK – hold. 'We're part of a movement building peace and respect in our country. We'll do all that we can to make sure he hears that message during his visit to Scotland.'Political leaders across the UK have ruled out meeting the presidential hopeful during his trip.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has branded his comments on Muslims 'repugnant' and 'offensive'.This week, David Cameron said that he 'has no plans' to meet Mr Trump during his visit.The tycoon is due to arrive by private jet for the reopening of Trump Turnberry, pictured, following a £200million refurbishmentTrump on a previous visit to Turnberry. Trump has stoked up inter-national fury after proposing policies including building a wall across the US border with Mexico and temporarily banning Muslims from entering AmericaScotland Against Trump co-ordinator Jonathan Shafi told the BBC: 'We'll be organising a protest which will reflect the broad opinion of Scots that his values are incompatible with ours.'Mr Shafi added that Mr Trump's brand is 'damaging to the Scottish economy'.But Christina Auld, owner of the Links Lodge near Turnberry, insisted that he is 'good for the area'. She said: 'I think the whole village is looking forward to him coming here. He's made amazing changes to the hotel. He's bringing in a lot of revenue. I just think he's going to make a great difference to the area.'A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'We have consulted with a number of protest groups in order to facilitate peaceful protest. This will be policed appropriately on the day.' 

Now is OUR chance to leave too: Voters in Sweden, Denmark and Greece demand their say on 'broken' Europe but Austria and Germany are devastated2016-6-24Britain's decision to leave the EU will pave the way for Greece, Sweden and Denmark to do the same, voters across Europe said today.But Germans and Austrians  were largely horrified by the UK's decision to sever ties with Europe - while France was split down the middle.MailOnline went out on to the streets of major capitals across the continent in the wake of the shock Brexit result and found messages of congratulations meshed with 'horror' at the political earthquake that has taken place.Konstantina Mpoikou, 26, PhD Student said: 'I don’t believe anything will drastically change regarding the British way of living, but things are going to get tougher for European citizens and the EU itself'Nathalie Blanchard, 50, an advertising executive from Paris, was very clear in her disapproval: ‘It’s a catastrophe.

The consequences will be enormous for the rest of Europe as well. The continent will be divided since the other European countries will look at Britain with contempt.'My main objection towards the EU is the high cost we in Sweden have to pay to stay in. I also think that a big issue is that the member countries immigration policy is so divided.'Björn Dahlgren, 30 years old, added: 'This is a positive opportunity for the EU. 'They can correct everything that is wrong in their system such as their lack of democratic insight for its citizens and all their strange laws.'The distance between Brussels and Europe´s citizens is enormous; that is something that needs to be dealt with.'I think Sweden should leave the EU.

Nations should work together and help each other.'There are of course problems with the EU, the enormous and slow bureaucracy is upsetting.'Mohammad Keshavarz, 60, added: 'I think it is very sad that they have decided to leave the union. Everything becomes very uncertain now.'I think we should still be members of the EU. We are a small country and need to cooperate. But we should keep our own currency.'The negative things I can see regarding the EU is the costs for the enormous bureaucracy in Brussels.'In Greece, there were calls to follow Britain and walk away from the EU.Florist Eleni Papadakis, 33, and a mother of one, said: 'I support Britain’s decision just like I supported Greece’s exit last year. The European Union is not a union anymore. 'It is just a couple of rich countries trying to get everything they can from the poorer ones. I don’t believe that any Greek government will ever take the leap and leave the EU; they are terrified. However, I strongly believe that some serious internal conflicts will definitely come up in Britain.' Konstantina Mpoikou, 26, PhD Student said: 'I don’t believe anything will drastically change regarding the British way of living, but things are going to get tougher for European citizens and the EU itself. 'This move will definitely shake the grounds the united Europe idea was born on, and more and more countries will follow. Maybe someday Greece too. 'The Eurozone was already weak. Now it’s just getting weaker.

It is not connected to the people.‘There is a democratic deficit.

They have taken the first step, and we will follow. 'The EU is a state in the state. Everything is dictated from the EU, and it costs us a lot of money. I believe Denmark can manage without the EU.Jamilla Eliassi, 24, from Sweden, did not support Brexit: 'I think it is sick that the UK has voted to leave. They are shooting themselves in the foot. Why stand alone instead of united with your neighbours.'It might be difficult, but Britain will get an agreement with the EU, and I'm sure it will work out fine. The world is not coming to an end because Britain has left.'Kenneth Poulsen, 37 years, a sales and marketing manager, added: 'I'm not surprised, but I think it's bad for Britain. 'It seemed like the more the politicians and the media argued for a yes to the EU, the more the population turned against them. 'People forget that it is because of the EU we don't have wars and a lot of things work. We' re going to see a different EU, this is just the beginning. 'I don't think, Denmark will leave because we're too small to stand outside. But if we had an election in Denmark, people might also vote against the EU.'At 78, Lilian Vangberg, had huge reservations about walking away: 'I think it's a pity that Britain is leaving. It's like Europe is falling apart, and I'm afraid where it will end. 'I'm also afraid that Denmark will also try to leave the EU. I don't like borders and I think, we should stick together.'In Austria, there was widespread disapproval over the Brexit voteSilke Trapp, a 47-year-old IT-consultant, said: 'I'm absolutely shocked. I work for a US IT-company with European headquarters in London. The Brexit is a complete disaster. 'I can hardly find the words to describe how I feel about it. 'I have no idea what will happen next, but the company probably needs to be organized differently as a consequence.'The UK have always had a special status within the EU. They were always more sceptic than other member states, but I had never expected a leave vote. 'I think the remain side simply failed to explain all the positive things about the EU to its population. It was a failure on their part.Markus English, 22, a student at Vienna University said: 'I fear it could be the start of a complete disentegration of the most important political project of the past 50 years.'It was a great mistake to ask the British people. The timing was terrible, with the refugee crisis completely overshadowing all the good results the EU has created. 'In my view the decision should have been made by elected officials, not by way of a referendum.'Christina Thummer, 22, who works in tourism in Vienna, said: 'There could be a domino effect, if it goes well for the UK. I hope it never comes to that in Austria' Silke Trapp, a 47-year-old IT-consultant, said: 'I'm absolutely shocked. I work for a US IT-company with European headquarters in London. The Brexit is a complete disaster' Tarangeet Singh, 25, unemployed, received political asylum in Austria two years ago:'I wish for every member country to stay in the European Union. We are more strong together than as individual states. 'I was very surprised to hear that UK voted to leave. I only hope this won't make other countries leave too. I personally worry about how this could affect free movement within Europe. The Sikhs live all over the world. 'I have a sister who lives in England. I don't know if this could make it more difficult for us to maintain close relations, but I worry about it.Josef Glanzer, 57,  a technician with international plant construction firm added: 'This is very, very bad new to all Europeans. Economically and politically it will damage Europe severely, I think. My biggest fear is that the Brexit will destabilise the entire EU.'I fear the pressure for referenda in other member states will increase now - it's an alarming  development. I don't expect - or support - an Austrian referendum.Christina Thummer, 22, who works in tourism: 'There could be a domino effect, if it goes well for the UK. I hope it never comes to that in Austria. We would be much worse off without the economic co-operation within the EU.'In Germany, Rita Seeburg, 56, a cleaning lady who grew up in East Berlin under the communists, said: 'I think the British have made a great mistake. 'Any club is strong when the membership remains together. I think their leaving will only weaken Germany, German jobs and the euro in the long term.'Dieter Wehmeyer, 44, a barman, said: 'We gave up on referendums in Germany after Hitler because the populist vote is too easily manipulated.'I think Britain voted for an image of itself that hasn't been a reality for several decades. Just what do these Brexiteers thjnk their vote will bring. Crazy. But its your decision and you will have to live with it.'Eberhard Seletzky, 52, a car salesman in west Berlin, said: 'Extraordinary. I don't think this was a vote about the EU at all but an explosion of hatred towards an elite both in London and in Brussels. 'But then again, Britain never had the longing for the EU project that we on continental Europe have.  'I think it an act of immense self harm. But the EU will survive and I think the UK will be the poorer for leaving it.'Public opinion on Brexit was further divided in neighbouring Ireland, where some spoke of their concern surrounding the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Brendan Kernan, 62, from Lusk in Dublin, said: ‘It’s a possibility that people might start coming to Ireland to go onto the UK. We don’t have great connections to Europe other than Rosslare port or the airports. Carsten Hartmann, 45 years, a construction worker in Copenhagen said: 'It's great Britain is leaving. They have taken the first step, and we will follow'‘The free area between ourselves and the UK needs to be strengthened. Our order posts, if we want to keep the free movement between Northern Ireland and ourselves, we will need to strengthen our border controls between ourselves and the rest of Europe.’Mr Kernan also said the referendum result could reignite trouble in the North.He said: ‘What is more concerning for us directly is the potential for the Northern Ireland situation to deteriorate because they certainly have one side being polarised as being back in the UK and the other side are kind of hoping for a united Ireland. That might be a cause for concern.’ Bank employee Alison Farrell said it is likely immigrants will look to Ireland as a way of getting to the UK following the shock Brexit vote.Ms Farrell, 24, from Mount Merrion in Dublin, said: ‘I think they should have stayed in the EU. Immigration is obviously a big problem for them and I can see why they wouldn’t want to have that many people coming in. It impacts on the economy. Mr Casey, 30, from Celbridge in Kildare, added: ‘For immigration, I don’t think it will be a big concern for us. It’s not really been an Irish problem up until now so I don’t see it being an issue for us.‘The immigration issue and the move to the right [in the UK] is also kind of worrying.‘I’d be more concerned between the border between north and south because that could become an issue again.' 

Churchill wouldn't have wanted us to make the 'terrible mistake' of quitting the EU, says wartime Prime Minister's grandson2016-6-21Winston Churchill's grandson has dismissed the idea that the wartime leader would vote for Brexit in the EU referendum.Sir Nicholas Soames insisted it was not a 'sensible idea' to diminish our influence and undermine security by cutting ties with Brussels.But the Tory MP said he feared the country was on the 'verge of making a terrible mistake'. The warning came with just two days to go before the crucial referendum on whether we should stay in the EU or not.Polls have shown that the vote is finely balanced as campaigning enters its final phase. Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames hit out at those who claim his grandfather would have supported Brexit during an interviewAppealing for the public to consider the 'future of your children', Sir Nicholas said: 'You are going to take the most important decision that you have taken for a generation, of your lifetime.'A decision that is going to affect your future, the future of your children and your grandchildren, the communities where you live.'And above all else, the future of your country. I simply don't believeit is a sensible idea in a very difficult, still hostile world, for Britiain to cut herself off from that which has given her partly a great deal of stability, of coherence.'It has magnified our influence and our power in the world.'Being in the EU has a magnifying effect, it is not a diminishing effect.'For us to say we do not want any more of this we are so successful, we are so powerful, we are so great at what we do that we don't need to be a member of that 500 million person organisation of 28 countries, we can go it alone.'I think that is such a mistake and I beg you as you stand in that polling booth to cast that vote of historic proportion, that you will vote for Britain to remain a member of the EU.'Sir Nicholas said leaving the EU now would be a 'terrible mistake'Sir Nicholas said he feared that the nation 'could be on the verge of making a terrible mistake'.And he invoked the memory of his grandfather Winston Churchill, who led Britain to victory in the Second World War. He said the founders of the EU had understood that there could 'never again be this terrible conflict between France and Germany involving Britain riding to the rescue'.'I believe we would be betraying everything they set out to do'.'People say to me well, Churchill would have wanted, he definitely would have wanted out.'Everyone claims him for their own. 'It is 51 years since his death and do we really, any of us, think seriously that Churchill would look out over the world today with all the instability still and its difficulties and its challenges,and say this is the right moment for Britain to cut itself free against all the advice of all our allies?'I feel that he would think it wasn't, that the founders of Europe would think it was not.'I think people would be amazed if we were to take the wrong decision.'

Which way is the Brexit? Boris Johnson urges voters 'change the course of history' ton Thursday as he visits truck business2016-6-20Boris Johnson today warned voters have one chance to 'change the whole course of European history' by backing Brexit on Thursday.As the long-awaited referendum moves into its final hours and with the polls finely balanced, the Vote Leave champion said voters had a 'fundamental decision' to make.Mr Johnson, who was back on the stump at Ipswich firm Trucks R Us today, said the Remain campaign was offering 'nothing... but the steady and miserable erosion of Parliamentary democracy' in Britain.This way for Brexit: Boris Johnson warned voters have one chance to 'change the whole course of European history' by backing Brexit on ThursdayThe former London Mayor took control on the campaign trail today ahead of Thursday's voteDavid Cameron last night made his final pitch to voters in a live BBC Question Time special, insisting a strong economy underpinned everything else - but he was lashed again and again over immigration.Referendum campaigning will again be muted today as MPs gather in Westminster to pay tribute to Jo Cox at an emergency recall of the House of Commons in the wake of her killing.A final push will begin tomorrow night when Boris Johnson takes part in the biggest live TV debate of the campaign at Wembley Arena.In his final newspaper column before the vote, the ex-Mayor of London wrote in the Daily Telegraph: 'When you pick up your ballot paper this Thursday, you have it in your hands to transform Britain's current democratic arrangements for the better.'You can change the whole course of European history – and if you vote Leave, I believe that change will be overwhelmingly positive. 'If we vote Remain, we stay locked in the back of the car, driven by someone with an imperfect command of English, and going a direction we don't want to go.'As the referendum heads into its final hours, polls are mixed. Results out over the weekend revealed a tie, Remain leads of up to 3 per cent and Leave leads of 2% Boris Johnson returned to the campaign trail at Ipswich firm Trucks R Us today as he urged voters to seize their chance to 'change the course of European history' by endorsing Brexit on Thursday Mr Johnson said a Remain vote would do nothing to 'rebuke the elites in Brussels' or allow Britain to set up a trade deal with America, China or India. And in a clear dismissal of Mr Cameron - who just last night insisted Britain was better in the room, at the negotiating table, Mr Johnson said: 'We are not more powerful, or more influential for being around the table in Brussels.'Look at the pitiful results of the so-called renegotiation earlier this year. We are drowned out.Nobel laureates from around the world have urged voters to back staying in the EU in Thursday's referendum, warning of long-lasting economic damage after a vote to leave. With just three days to go until voters finally go to the polls to decide the future of Britain's EU membership, 10 Nobel-prize laureates in the world of economics claimed Brexit would 'create major uncertainty about Britain's alternative future trading arrangements'. The leading professors said the UK's trading relationships with the rest of Europe, north American and China would be put in jeopardy if Britain leaves the EU. Writing in a letter to the Guardian today, they write: 'These effects, though one-off, would persist for many years. 'Thus the economic arguments are clearly in favour of remaining in the EU,' the 10 Nobel-prize winners conclude. However economics laureate Christopher Pissarides said today that the outcome of Thursday's historic referendum could come down to the failure of the Remain campaign to explain what's at stake for Britain and the wider world. He said the impact of a Brexit vote would have much far-reaching consequences than people had so far warned. 'The impact from a Brexit will be worse than most people think and it's partly the failure of the campaign to remain to point it out,' Pissarides warned. 'When you have a process that started 60 years ago and then suddenly you reverse - it will not be a temporary glitch, it is going to be a massive bump,' he added. 'And it is an illusion to think that if we vote to Remain, we are somehow opting for the status quo. 'The status quo is not on offer. If we stay in, we will be engaged willy-nilly in the desperate attempt to keep the euro together, by building an economic government of Europe.'Mr Johnson said he wanted to hand 'power back to the people' because democracy was the 'best way of correcting the errors of our people'.He said: 'Now is the time to believe in ourselves, and in what Britain can do, and to remember that we always do best when we believe in ourselves.'Of course we can continue to provide leadership and support for Europe – but inter-governmentally, outside the supranational EU system.'I hope you will vote Leave, and take back control of this great country's destiny; and if we Vote Leave, then all our votes will count for more in the future.'This chance will not come again in our lifetimes, and I pray we do not miss it.'Mr Johnson will again be joined by Labour's Gisela Stuart and Tory Andrea Leadsom when he takes to the Wembley Arena stage tomorrow night.For the Remain side, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and TUC chief Frances O'Grady.In his final live TV event last night, Mr Cameron recalled Winston Churchill as he pleaded with voters to back him on Thursday. He said: 'In my office I sit two yards away from the Cabinet Room where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler - the best and greatest decision perhaps anyone's ever made in our country, right?'He didn't want to be alone, he wanted to be fighting with the French and with the Poles and the others, but he didn't quit.'He didn't quit in Europe, he didn't quit on European democracy, he didn't quit on European freedom.'We want to fight for these things today and you can't win, you can't fight if you're not in the room. You can't win a football match if you're not on the pitch.'The Prime Minister's spirited defence of the EU came after one audience member said he was a '21st century Neville Chaberlain' for hailing the deal he negotiated with the leaders of the other 27 member states.Boris Johnson, pictured greeting workers at the truck firm today, urged voters to seize their one and only chance to quit the EU at the referendum on ThursdayDavid Cameron, pictured at the Mini factory today, recalled Winston Churchill as he pleaded with voters to back his Remain campaign on ThursdayDavid Cameron has been told by allies not to hand Boris Johnson a Cabinet job if Britain votes to stay in the EU on Thursday, it emerged today. Pro-EU ministers and MPs want him to scrap plans for a 'unity reshuffle,' insisting Brexit ministers and MPs had been disloyal by campaigning so vociferously the Prime Minister.Employment minister Priti Patel has been one of the most aggressive Out campaigners who have attacked government policy despite being a Cabinet minister herself, but Justice Secretary Michael Gove - a close friend of Mr Cameron - has not held back from criticising the Government's record.  Mr Johnson, pictured at Vote Leave's final weekend rally yesterday, said voters had the power to 'transform Britain's current democratic arrangements for the better' at Thursday's referendum Mr Johnson was tipped to be given a top job in government as a gesture to the Leave camp of the Tory party and an attempt to put the bitter infighting within the party to bed.A minister campaigning for a Remain vote on Thursday told the Daily Telegraph: 'People who backed the Prime Minister and made the case for the EU would be outraged to see people who attacked the Government getting promoted.'But failure to promote pro-Brexit Tory MPs risks causing a long-lasting rift in the party over Europe. Mr Gove is expected to keep his role in Cabinet, but other pro-Brexit Cabinet ministers are expected to be demoted in favour of younger, more loyal MPs. Chris Grayling, Leader of the House of Commons, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers could lose their jobs along with Ms Patel. Vote Leave campaigner Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, could return to Cabinet if Mr Cameron decides in favour of a unity reshuffle. However some within the party believe Mr Cameron will wait until the autumn to reshuffle his top team in order to calm tensions in the party after months of blue-on-blue civil war, which has dominated newspaper headlines and some fear done permanent damage the party's image. Employment minister Priti Patel (pictured) has been one of the most aggressive Out campaigners who have attacked government policy despite being a Cabinet minister herself, but Justice Secretary Michael Gove - a close friend of Mr Cameron - has not held back from criticising the Government's recordTory peer Baroness Warsi claimed to have switched to the Remain campMaverick Tory peer Baroness Warsi last night claimed to have switched to the Remain camp in protest over a controversial Nigel Farage immigration poster.However, her high-profile 'defection' was greeted with bafflement among Leave supporters - who could not remember her ever campaigning in their side.Lady Warsi's claims were made following a day when a Ukip poster claiming migration was pushing the continent to 'breaking point' were condemned by all sides.Last night she told The Times: 'That breaking point poster really was - for me - the breaking point to say: 'I can't go on supporting this'.She added: 'We all feel very passionately about these issues, it's when you start to believe that any means are acceptable to achieve an end. It's not an easy decision.'When I look at the people who are now saying the things they are saying and the people who are supporting that approach, the BNP, Donald Trump, Marine le Pen, Austria's Freedom Party — every day it feels like the far right is coming out to stand by Leave.' She later told the BBC: 'This kind of nudge-nudge, wink-wink xenophobic racist campaign may be politically savvy or politically useful in the short term, but it causes long-term damage to communities.'The vision that me and other Brexiters who have been involved right from the outset, who had a positive outward-looking vision of what a Brexit vote might mean, unfortunately those voices have now been stifled.'What we see is the divisive campaign which has resulted in people like me and others who are deeply Eurosceptic and want to see a reformed relationship feel that they now have to leave Leave.'But a spokesman for Vote Leave said the campaign was confused by Lady Warsi's announcement.He said: 'We don't remember Warsi ever joining our campaign so we are puzzled by her claims to have defected.'Daniel Hannan, the high profile Tory MEP and Leave campaigner, said: 'When I invited Sayeeda Warsi to join the Leave campaign, she declined. Fair enough, obviously. But how is this a 'defection'?'Tory MP Bernard Jenkin added: 'I helped set up Vote Leave and she has not been at a single meeting I have attended. ''Defects'' just not accurate!.'
